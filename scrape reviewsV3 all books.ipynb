      "[('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Sophia.', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6520961-sophia', 'Nov 02, 2011', '', '5590', ' * Warning: If you\\'re easily offended by cursing, and/or aggressivity, then don\\'t FUCKING read this. *I am literally losing it. This book contains one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever read in any book. EVER.So here\\'s one excerpt from the book. Abby slept with Travis and left his apartment in the morning without saying goodbye. This is his reaction, a few hours later : “Travis is a fucking wreck! He won’t talk to us, he’s trashed theapartment, threw the stereo across the room… Shep [roommate] can’t talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It’s scaring me! Abby, he’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was… Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door… broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!”THIS. IS. NOT. OKAY.It\\'s not okay it\\'s not okay it\\'s not okay it\\'s NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. A few lines later, Abby calls him and everything\\'s back to normal. NO. I\\'M SORRY BUT NO. YOU NEED TO STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM HIM!Stalker :A person obsessed with another to the point of insanity, I.E. following one everywhere, calling constantly, showing signs of irrational, sick and unhealthy behavior, that can sometimes lead to extreme violence. It drives me insane to see how stalkerish behavior is considered as \"hot\". This book is really, really disturbing, and I don\\'t understand how it could get published. I got \\'til chapter 9 and basically I can\\'t take it anymore. The guy, Travis, suffers from very, very, VERY serious problems that should lead him straight into a shrink\\'s office (if not prison). I\\'m serious. Hey you girls, out there, who gave that book 5 stars, saying you want a Travis in your lives, in WHAT language do we have to tell you : it\\'s NOT normal behavior! And thank God that you haven\\'t met a guy like him because then that would be fucking dramatic! Don\\'t you understand how pathetic it is - all this characterization into unrealistic, hyper-sexualized, robotic male figures? These stories are all the fucking same! The guy is drop dead gorgeous, he\\'s dangerous, he\\'s sexy, he wants you even if you\\'re plain like hell and what he feels for you goes beyond words: Edward Cullen, Christian Grey, Patch Cipriano, Kellan Kyle, Travis Maddox, Damen Auguste or Dimitri Belikov, they\\'re all the same! Girls, NO ONE is going to want to watch you sleep, or forbid you to go visit your friends, or try to kill you because they love you so fucking much, because that\\'s not what NORMAL people do!! If you ever have the misfortune to get involved with someone like that, GO FILE A FUCKING RESTRAINING ORDER already! I find it appalling that young girls actually read this thinking this is exactly how they want to be treated like someday! We\\'re not pets! No fucking one in the world should be allowed to force you into behaving like a child! And I\\'m also thinking about boys, they\\'re not exactly the target audience but still; reading this must lead to wonder if this kind of behavior is what chicks like. It just spreads some sort of sickening message, \"be aggressive, show your jealousy as well as the fact that she\\'s yours, have no limits & be in control, use your strength to make a point, don\\'t let her do what she wants because she doesn\\'t really know what\\'s good for her. You know better\". It\\'s so hard to be a teenager, to try to find who you truly are, fiction that is destined to be read by young people has some kind of role, it should set examples instead of showing dysfunctional and extreme codependent relationships like they\\'re normal, because they\\'re not.Hey! YOUNG. ADULTS. That means you\\'re becoming a damn citizen, that you\\'ll study, get to vote, graduate, get a job and make a living! How could you ever want someone to be that intrusive? To go as far as breaking your car down so you can\\'t visit a friend?! (yes, Edward fucking Cullen I\\'m talking about you because YOU STARTED ALL THIS!)Don\\'t you realize it\\'s an offense to your FREEDOM when a guy\\'s literally forbidding you to get out of his house - even after you\\'ve asked him to let you go? When he\\'s dragging you out of the car because you\\'re making out with someone - all this when you\\'re not even involved with him? When he\\'s making you feel like shit because you\\'re seeing someone else? In fact, I won\\'t even get started on all the stupid reactions of Abby. What kind of girl dates a sweet guy and then goes sleeping in another man\\'s bed every night, when she HAS a choice ? She\\'s just a (stupid, lying and masochist) tease.Then she encourages Travis to beat the shit out of someone in the middle of the cafeteria? Seriously? Just because someone whistles at her or something, she says like \"Teach him some manners!\", and Travis throws himself on the man. Jesus, HONESTLY are you a beast or something? The poor guy ends up curled up in fetal position, covered in blood and unable to move. WTF? How can you stand this? No really, how can you read this? How can you accept it? Where is your sense of civility, or your instinct of protection towards the human kind? How come no one in the cafeteria stands up and tries to stop this? Easy answer. Because everyone is fucking terrified to get hurt! Like that\\'s normal!It scares the shit out of me to see that some people are able to read such violence and yet remain flippant and oh-so-casual like it\\'s no big deal. It makes me wonder, if they ever witness a real beat-up, would they react? Would they care? Or has modern entertainment succeeded in making all forms of abuse look so cavalier that it doesn\\'t shock anyone anymore?..Travis kept opening the door when Abby was with her date on the porch late at night, or coming in the bathroom when she was taking a shower, refusing to get out, and generally being so nosy it was a shocking wonder how NO ONE told him to fuck off! And that bitch didn\\'t even say ANYTHING! It\\'s so genuinely dangerous when a guy\\'s emotionally abusing/blackmailing you, or yelling at you for not obeying him, or trying to manipulate you! It is BUT romantic ! I don\\'t give a damn whether the guy\\'s a vampire, or an angel, or a fucking rock star, or if it was a bet or not, it\\'s just NOT okay!How could violence keep being depicted as something acceptable - let alone romantic? They\\'re at a party and he hits a boy who TOUCHES her ARM. Honestly! It\\'s not a game! And she keeps forgiving him, every single time.How do you think real abusive relationships start? What do you think are the profiles of the men who end up beating up their wives and/or showing extreme paranoiac behavior? (\"Did you just look at that guy? Did you fuck him? Are you cheating on me? Don\\'t you lie to me, bitch. I can see it in your eyes!\" This is how it ends, people.) You just wait a couple of years, Abby. Just wait until he loses it, AGAIN, and ends up taking a fucking swing at you.Again, awfully stupid and arrogant Abby stays at Travis\\'s apartment and she sleeps in his bed because she doesn\\'t really have a choice. Fine. But the guy\\'s bringing chicks in the living room, having a big loud threesome.. And one day later, he takes Abby\\'s hand, acts all warm and fuzzy, saying stuff like \"You\\'re better than this [I\\'m not fucking you like I fuck the rest of \\'em], that\\'s why I treat you different, don\\'t you ever get near boys or I swear I\\'ll destroy them.\" He even says \"I\\'ll end up in prison if I hear you slept with someone else\". When you read something like that your fucking alarm must spark off! I don\\'t know what to say anymore because honestly I feel like I shouldn\\'t even have to say all this in the first place. This should be like, SURVIVAL INSTINCT. What is this message that\\'s conveyed? Should we girls be standing on the corner, watching our love interest that pretendedly loves us fuck his brains out with the whole planet and calmly stating \"I can deal with his behavior because, well, he\\'s really hot\"? Or because he\\'s so romantic that he managed to nickname her after the most stupid volatile on earth, a.k.a Pidgeon?NO. FUCK NO. Why would you want to lock yourself up in some scary relationship where in the end, you just lose everything; your independence, as well as your right to have a life that doesn\\'t exclusively revolves around him? Why would you want to give up your liberty as an individual in order to be so tied up with your love interest that you can\\'t even breathe on your own? (And for those who pretendedly realized that it wasn\\'t healthy, but yet managed to like the book anyway: why would you want to witness such a relationship? What\\'s the pleasure in contemplating two people who never, ever realize how deep they\\'ve fallen into violence and abuse?) EDIT : I don\\'t care whether Travis (supposedly) changes at the end of the book. I don\\'t care for his pseudo redemption and/or efforts. What matters are the facts, here and now, that Abby acknowledges them while they\\'re horrible and still manages to stay with Travis. I couldn\\'t finish the fucking book because I was feeling sick to my stomach - and I insist on saying the characterization of the love story was goddamn awful and should never be seen as something okay. So do you honestly think I care when you say I should have finished it before writing all this? Give me a fucking break. I have witnessed abusive relationships in real life; this book depicts the beginning of one, and the memories alone are enough to make me wanna puke. I sure as hell won\\'t force myself to undergo the whole 400 pages. Besides, I read on some reviews that (spoilers):* At some point he won\\'t let her get out of the apartment because he thinks her clothes aren\\'t appropriate enough. Therefore he forces her to change. Okay. May I send you back to the \"This is not okay behavior\" part of the review? * They get married at Las Vegas (at 19).* That after him getting an \"Abby\" tattoo, she gets one too that reads \"Mrs Maddox\". I\\'d like to talk about this for a second. I\\'m a firm believer that you can love someone in an unconditional way without having to show it with material proofs. Marriage and tattoos? What is this? Travis unexpectedly got an \"Abby\" tattoo, without warning her, without considering the consequences of such an act (but I guess I\\'m asking too much from him, considering he\\'s got tribal tattoos all over his body). Anyway, Travis emotionally challenged her, and so she got one too. Again, what is this? A leash that she will never, ever be able to free herself from? What if their relationship doesn\\'t last? What if they get a divorce? Basically, until the day she dies, she will look at her skin and remember that at some point in her life, she chose to mark herself not as a person, but as a wife. As someone\\'s something. And that\\'s just terrible. So. *Breathe*. In my humble opinion, I think it is better that I just don\\'t finish it. Like, ever.I\\'m writing all this because I feel so MAD about this book. Women fought and still fight every day so we can be treated as equals and not as objects. I\\'m not going to sit still and pretend this book didn\\'t horrify me. Because it did. It fucking did, big time.Also believe it or not but I\\'m not doing this to tear the author down, I don\\'t really care about her, my review isn\\'t about her but about the book. It\\'s nothing personal, I respect her as a human being. I just feel very sorry for the messages she conveys through this everything but Beautiful Disaster. *** EDIT#2: : Yeah, so. About that. There seems to be some kind of Reviewers VS Authors movement here on Goodreads (but also on Amazon, Twitter, etc.). Since the author of Beautiful Disaster made me be a part of it, I\\'ve decided to join here two links. The first one is a blog post, written by author Hannah Moskowvitz. Check it out, it\\'s really good. Second one, written by Nafiza, on her blog. And I have one thing to say: you go, girl. *** EDIT#3: : One more, because McGuire just doesn\\'t know how to let it go. *** EDIT#4: : Yes, I know this is way too long already but I wanted to add something. For the trolls who\\'ve been telling me for the past fucking year that this is just fiction: not only do you come off as stupidly paradoxical for being on Goodreads in the first place, because it\\'s a website for people who feel passionate about books, but you\\'re also wrong. When you read a book for entertainment purposes only, you\\'re relaxed and receptive, almost vulnerable, as unconsciously, you assume that what you\\'re reading is okay and right (otherwise it wouldn\\'t be published, would it?) Therefore you don\\'t really pay attention to the real meaning behind what you\\'re reading. After all, \"It\\'s just a book\", right? Wrong. Sometimes you have to wake up, and realize that what you\\'re reading is in reality a dangerous stinking piece of shit. Yes, it\\'s a book, but young girls read this and unconsciously absorb the messages that are being sent, and then it has an impact on the way they carry out their personal lives, without even realizing that stupid books like this one contributed to giving her a black eye and pushing her down the stairs. Because they\\'ve been reading about that \"hot\" behavior for so long, they\\'ve been sexualizing it and they\\'ve been associating it with good looks, and of course, with the ultimate perfect happy ending. In reality, it doesn\\'t work like that. You can\\'t change someone who\\'s damaged and unstable just because you love them, no matter what the books try to tell you. Don\\'t waste your time trying. And the fact that Travis Maddox is described as being extremely hot is a manipulation that tries to trick you into thinking that if it\\'s beautiful, then it must be good. Think about that: a weird, ugly guy who follows you around and destroys his apartment because you didn\\'t pick up your phone wouldn\\'t be hot, it\\'d be creepy as fuck. And that\\'s what I\\'m asking you now: try to think beyond the \"good looks\" (and the sugarcoating that goes with it) that the medias are trying to feed you, and just think by yourself. By the way, it also leads to fucking idiotic bitches who tweet about how they wouldn\\'t mind being beaten up by Chris Brown because he\\'s so hot. What the fuck? There aren\\'t enough words to say how wrong this is. What do I care, you say? I care because I\\'m a woman and reading this makes me ashamed.Wake the fuck up, girls, and never accept being treated like that. You are an individual, you are important and you matter. Your decisions will have impacts. You deserve so much better than someone like this Travis-fucking-asshole. Let him go die in a fucking hole and go lead your own life like the independent and free person you are. And please, destroy the person who will so much as try to tell you otherwise. Finally, last but not least. Due to some comments, it feels like it\\'s time to clarify some stuff. If this review pissed you off, or offended you, you should know that I don\\'t give a shit about, well, what you think. If this is about my swearing, or my aggressivity, you were warned from the very first line and I don\\'t have anything to say to you about it. You knew it was a 1 star rating so basically, no one forced you to read but yourself. Get over it and move on. Simple as.And I know I mentioned the 5 stars ratings girls and all, but really it was just semantics, don\\'t feel like you should comment my review to express your disagreement or your undying love for Travis, cause whatever you say, it won\\'t change the way I feel. I mean it, don\\'t comment. Because I don\\'t give a fuck about what you have to say! Unless it is interesting, of course. But if you’re here to defend the psychopath and try to explain how in the end the relationship comes full circle, or why his unacceptable behavior is only masculine and protective, please SAVE YOUR TIME. (And mine). Obviously, we won\\'t get along and if you can\\'t understand what I\\'m trying to say then it\\'s fine, keep loving Eclipse and Blood Promise and Hush Hush, I mean, it\\'s cool. Honestly, I\\'m serious, tastes and perceptions and ideals are all different and I don\\'t have a say in this, and neither do you. So, well, you can just save your time with the comments. And fuck off already. Thank you.

This is where we meet Travis \\'Mad Dog\\' Maddox, the male romantic lead. He, of course, wins his fight. The female lead, Abby, is attending the fight club for the first time that night. She ends up with blood on her cashmere sweater and a new name given to her by Travis, who doesn\\'t even bother to ask for her name before arbitrarily deciding on \\'Pigeon.\\' It is the way one might rename a dog one has adopted.We meet Travis again in the cafeteria. He is being \"followed by two voluptuous bottle-blondes wearing Sigma Kappa tees. One of them sat on Travis\\' lap, the other sat beside him, pawing at his shirt.\" Abby\\'s best friend America, who also happens to be dating Travis\\'s cousin and roommate, makes a snide comment. One of the blonde\\'s calls her a skank. Travis \"lets his knees give way, sending her tumbling to the floor\" because America is his friend. This little interlude sets up two major reoccurring issues: girl on girl hate and Travis treating girls like garbage to step over. Every girl in the book except for Abby and America is a skank, a bitch or a bitchy skank. As for Travis, this incident of deliberately humiliating a girl in public and dropping her on the floor like the used condom wrapper she represents to him is actually as close to a gentleman as he ever gets because this is one of the mildest examples of his behavior.After lunch, Travis and Abby conveniently have a class together although they seemed to have seen each other for the first time at the fight last night. Whatever, get used to this author making up shit as she goes along and writing inconsistently from start to finish. I can give you a list of minor (yet annoying) continuity issues in the comment section below if asked.Travis fixates on Abby and sits beside her, leaving disappointed girls by his usual seat. He indicates she should take notes for him and spends the rest of the class zoned out. Never fear though! Travis is a freaking genius. He doesn\\'t need notes or studying or attending classes to ace the grades. On a similar note, he also does not need to eat healthy or exercise to maintain his muscle mass and six pack! I\\'m sorry, but every guy I\\'ve talked to with a body like Travis\\'s could go on extensively about his diet and workout regime. We don\\'t have to worry about believability in this world because despite the lack of traditional fantasy markings nothing about this book remotely resembles reality. In this world, control and abuse can turn into a happily ever after.With minimal effort Travis pesters Abby into agreeing to come to his apartment after school with her friend America, who is there often to see her own boyfriend, Shepley, Travis\\'s cousin. She agrees and then attempts to dress in the most disgusting way possible: \"My hair was piled on top of my head in a messy bun. I had scrubbed the makeup from my face and repalced my contacts with rectangular black-rimmed glasses. Sporting a ratty t-shirt and sweatpants, I shuffles along in a pair of flip flops.\" I\\'ll hold on while you get your favorite religious artifact to hold off this monster. This description pretty much matches me at the moment on my day off. Rawr.Anyway, Travis is not put off by this visual and decides to drag her out to dinner, which he *gasp* never does with the girls he sleeps with. Abby\\'s friend America is the least helpful person when it comes to rejecting Travis\\'s unwanted advances.\"I was just heading out for dinner. You hungry, Pidge?\" (We still have no idea why he\\'s calling her this.)\"I already ate,\" I shrugged. (Dialogue is routinely shrugged and smiled rather than spoken.)\"No you haven\\'t,\" America said before realizing her mistake. \"Oh...er...that\\'s right, I forgot you grabbed a... pizza? Before we left.\"I can\\'t even tell you how much trouble my friend would be in if she did that to me. Still crappy friend aside, no one forces Abby to go with Travis, no one forces her to get on the back of her motorcycle. She does all of these things despite being extremely uncomfortable around him because Abby is an idiot. During dinner Travis opens up to her about his dead mother and they connect a bit. So much so that he insists on sitting beside her the next day at lunch by bullying someone else out of an already occupied chair. And it is bullying. He does not ask for the chair so much as claims it already belongs to him (much like Abby) and then he stares the guy down until he moves. Abby is pleased with the attention and the girls looking at her to see who Travis insisted on sitting beside.The next big plot movement involves broken boilers in America and Abby\\'s dorm room. America\\'s solution is that they move in with Shep and Travis until they fix the boilers. What... the hell? I can\\'t comprehend how moving off campus to be near hot water could possibly be more convenient than living on campus and heading to an off campus apartment once a day for a shower. Really, you\\'re not supposed to be thinking this much, but since Abby protests vehemently before capitulating you do get a lot of time to think about what a stupid idea this is. I would have preferred a day of skipping a shower or a cold shower to living with someone who made me uncomfortable.Abby and America arrive at the apartment just as Travis\\'s latest fling(?) is getting ready to leave. She offers him her number and he declines in front of an audience of two other girls and his roommate, letting her know exactly what she means. They\\'re not a silent audience either: \"Every time!\" America said. She looked at the woman. \"How are you surprised by this? He\\'s Travis fucking Maddox! He\\'s famous for this very thing, and every time they\\'re surprised!\"America\\'s boyfriend must comfort her after she delivers this tirade even though the girl she insinuated was, at best, naive and, at worse, stupid is still standing there. Abby is not pleased with all of this because she didn\\'t realize \"Shepley\\'s apartment was a revolving door for clueless bimbos.\" I love how other girls in this book are treated. It\\'s just fantastic. My favorite is Abby calling the girls Travis sleeps with STD infested imbeciles.Abby \"stared at the couch, the cushions still askew and bunched up from its recent use. I recoiled at the thought of how many women had given themselves away against the fabric. Itchy fabric at that.\" Nice, right? Nothing about Travis or how he treated them, just the awful, dirty sexually active girls.Abby decides she can\\'t possibly sleep on the couch so Travis offers her his bed. He does not fuck girls in there. This speaks volumes about how he views women, good enough for his dick, not good enough for his sheets. I\\'ll kill the suspense here. He sleeps with her in his bed, but not before he keeps wandering in and out of the bathroom while she\\'s showering! He brings her a towel and her toothbrush while she\\'s showering and then ignores her shrieks at him to get out. He does not knock before entering the bathroom nor did he announce himself. He just opens the door and makes himself at home. It\\'s creepy. He brings her stuff in, which means he went through her bags. She shrieks about him going through her stuff and he ignores her, not offering an excuse or apology. She shrieks at him to get out again and he insists he has to brush her teeth all while she\\'s naked on the other side of the curtain. It\\'s all invasive, scary, and the start of a very alarming and controlling relationship.I wouldn\\'t have finished showering. I would have gotten dressed, soapy hair and all, before heading back to my home. Abby, who has stood in the shower with her arms wrapped defensively around her chest listening to him brush his teeth, gets out of the shower and SMILES at the night moisturizer Travis brought her while violating her privacy and personal space. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.During Abby and America\\'s long stay with Travis and Shepley (seriously, the campus couldn\\'t open another dorm building for them to shower in?), they all go to a bar together. In an attempt to prove they\\'re not sleeping together to the rest of the school Travis and Abby dance together? I don\\'t get the logic there. Anyway he licks her throat. She is not happy. He\\'s mad she\\'s not happy and grinds up on some other girl. She flirts with the bartender, but Travis puts a swift stop to that! Because the guy is a rapist! He\\'s been arrested for it and Travis knows all about it! Thank God for Travis. Thank God for his instructions not to take drinks from anyone but him and his cousin, because they treat girls with all the respect in the world and are the most upstanding citizens to take drinks from. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.They are still a foursome when Travis gets called for another fight. He asks Abby to go with him. America gives her non-Abbyish clothes to wear (a deep cut, yellow halter top and tight, low-rise jeans). Travis takes one look at her and DEMANDS she change. Travis\\'s mouth fell open. \"Oh, hell no. Are you trying to get me killed? You\\'ve gotta change, Pidge.\"\"What?\" I asked, looking down.America grabbed her hips. \"She looks cute, Trav, leave her alone!\"Travis took my hands and led me down the hall. \"Get a t-shirt on... and some sneakers. Something comfortable.\"\"What? Why?\"\"Because I\\'ll be more worried about who\\'s looking at your tits in that shirt instead of Hoffman,\" he said, stopping at his door.\"I thought you said you didn\\'t give a damn what anyone else thought?\"\"That\\'s a different scenario, Pigeon.\" Travis looked down at my chest and then up at me. \"You can\\'t wear this to a fight, so please... just... please just change,\" he stuttered, shoving me into the room and shutting me in. Abby gets changed.Then she gets on his stupid motorcycle again while he drives dangerously. When they get there, Travis claims he can go his entire fight without getting hit. Abby calls bullshit. Travis offers to make a bet. He won\\'t sleep with anyone for a month if he gets hit. If he doesn\\'t get hit she has to continue living with him in his apartment for a month. I don\\'t even have words to express how I felt when this stupid girl took this stupid bet, but she does. Travis wins. She must live with him. I think when you take away someone\\'s constant choice to be with you then it becomes skeevy.Shepley gets angry at Abby for the agreement because she promised not to get involved with Travis. Whenever Travis screws around with the best friend of the girl he\\'s dating it ends badly for him. Of course, he doesn\\'t fight with Travis or demand promises of Travis, no he screams at the girl. Abby insists there\\'s nothing sexual between them and that there never will be. Travis comes out of the shower during all her insisting and gets annoyed. As revenge he goes to a bar, comes home at two AM with not one but two girls. He goes into the room where Abby is sleeping, fishes through his bedside table for some condoms and heads back out into the living room to have a threesome. She sits there listening to him giggling and moaning etc because she can\\'t leave the bedroom without walking through the living room where his little threesome is going on. When he\\'s finished, he kicks the girls out, and he gets back in bed with her reeking of whiskey.She gets out of bed, steps over condom wrappers and sleeps on the reclining chair. In the morning, America acts like a real friend for the first time and packs Abby\\'s things to take her home. Even Shepley is contrite. Travis wanders in during this conversation, having already been out to buy all of Abby\\'s favorite foods for the month she will be staying with him. I\\'m going to pause and say gifts after emotional or physical abuse are part of a pretty common cycle. Abby stays because Abby is an idiot who insists a bet is a bet. Travis apologizes and hedges around letting her out of the bet. When Abby indicates it is the only thing keeping her there he holds her to it.While she\\'s living with Travis, Abby starts a tentative relationship with a boy named Parker who seems pretty decent. Travis responds as one might expect even though he has made no real romantic gesture towards Abby when she leaves a party with Parker.He leaned in, seeming flustered. \"I\\'ll kill him if he touches you.\"\"I like him,\" I said, emphasizing each word.He seemed stunned at my confession and then his features turned severe. \"Fine. If he ends up holding you down in the backseat of a car, don\\'t come crying to me.\"Convenient how every guy except Travis is a rapist. Of course, Parker is not really a rapist. Travis is just insinuating it to scare Abby into going home with him. Because Travis is the safe choice. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.Parker behaves like a gentleman, kissing her cheek goodnight. Travis is waiting so close to the door that he opens it before she can push which causes her to fall in. He does this just about every time she goes on a date with Parker. The only exception, I believe, was when he drunkenly went down to the car where they were kissing and pulled her out of it. The wheels of Parker\\'s shiny Porsche squealed out of the parking lot, and Travis lit a cigarette. \"You can go inside now, Mare.\"She tugged on my skirt. \"C\\'mon, Abby.\"\"Why don\\'t you stay, Abs,\" he seethed.I nodded for America to go ahead and she reluctantly complied. I crossed my arms, ready for a fight, preparing myself to lash out at him after the inevitable lecture. Travis took several drags from his cigarette, and when it was obvious that he wasn\\'t going to explain my patience ran out.\"Why did you do that?\" I asked.\"Why? Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!\" he yelled. His eyes were unfocused, and I could see he was incapable of rational conversation.I kept my voice calm. \"I may be staying with you, but what I do, and who I do it with is my business.\" (good for you, Abby!)He flicked his cigarette to the ground. \"You\\'re so much better than that, Pidge. Don\\'t let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.\"\"I wasn\\'t going to have sex with him!\" (so much for it being her business.)More vomit inducing craziness in which Abby accuses him of spying on her. He tells her he doesn\\'t want to know about when she sleeps with Parker. She says that would be a big step for her. He says that\\'s what all girls say. Abby says, \"I don\\'t mean the sluts you deal with! I mean me! I haven\\'t... ugh! Nevermind.\"Yes, she\\'s a virgin so she really is different from all the sluts he slept with! Ugh is right. I think waiting for someone you\\'re really comfortable with and really in love with is a good thing, but I also never felt superior to girls who felt differently about it. The girl on girl hate in this book is ridiculous.After Travis humiliates Abby in front of her date, intimidates and threatens her date until he leaves, and laughs with delight and relief over her virginity he then attempts to drunkenly seduce her. Abby goes along with it. (This is where I felt a migraine coming on). The seduction stops because Travis doesn\\'t want it to be like that between them. Lovely that the drunk Neanderthal calls all the shots.I\\'m only at thirty percent of the book here and I only have 25% of the room left to review so I\\'m going to start doing some heavy condensing.Creepy Things Travis Does:1. He buys Abby a puppy for her birthday to keep at his apartment so that she will always have to come back.2. He beats his friends to a bloody pulp in the school cafeteria for making sexual innuendos about Abby. In reality he would\\'ve got tasered by security. After several incidents he would\\'ve been kicked out of the university, but don\\'t worry about reality in this book.3. He lets Parker and the rest of the school believe he\\'s sleeping with Abby to chase him away.4. He refuses to allow Abby out of the bet even though he is strangling her healthy relationship with Parker.5. Immediately after Abby and Travis sleep together he calls himself her last first kiss then he destroys the apartment and rages at Shepley and America for helping her leave when his words creeps her out.6. After only a few weeks, he tattoos \"Pigeon\" on his wrist and a long Hebrew scripture quote about belonging to your beloved and your beloved belonging to you. Never has the word \\'belonging\\' seemed so threatening.7. Screams at her for accepting a drink from another guy because it could have roofies in it and besides, she\\'s HIS GIRL, HE will buy her drinks. NO ONE ELSE.8. Punches a guy who is touching her while her face is inches away from the guy\\'s face.9. Stalks her after a break up. Lies to his family about them still being together. Manipulates her into pretending to still be a couple so she\\'ll cook dinner Thanksgiving dinner for his family. Kisses and has sex with her even though he\\'s promised he wouldn\\'t cross those lines again. (I\\'m not absolving Abby of her stupidity here either.)10. Stalks her some more. Drags guys away from dancing with her. Threatens their lives if they go near her. Tosses her over his shoulder and drags her out of a party. Demands a designated driver take them to his apartment, drags her kicking and screaming out of the driver\\'s car, tosses her in his apartment. Somehow they end up having sex. Don\\'t fucking ask me. It grossed me out -- I can\\'t stomach re-reading it.Awful Plot Devices:1. Zac Effron sing along. I read in another review that Travis had the charm to pull off a Zac Effron sing along. I thought this was meant to be an exaggerated comparison... it was not. He sings Rolling Stone\\'s (I Can\\'t Get No) Satisfaction in the school cafeteria with the football players as back up singers. This is really not a joke.2. A trip to Vegas where Travis fights to win money so Abby can pay the debt her big time gambling father has transfered to her. Oh, did I not mention she is the daughter of a famous poker player?3. Travis getting offered $100,000 per fight to continue fighting in Vegas. He decides to take the offer despite Abby\\'s protests and then is shocked and a rage maniac when she breaks up with him because of it, despite knowing she wanted nothing to do with that lifestyle4. A basement fire at fight club bought on by gas lanterns. Because people really use those anymore. Don\\'t worry! Everyone important lives. Because this is reality.5. Abby proposes, they go to Vegas again to get married, she gets a tattoo that reads Mrs. Maddox and mentally refers to it as a brand several times.Real Ways this Book Could Have Ended in Order to be Realistic and Send a Message:1. Travis kills Abby in a drunken fit of rage over something she\\'s wearing, saying, and/or doing. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail.2. Travis kills some guy for interacting with Abby in a way he deems inappropriate. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail and either A. Abby visits him twice a week for the rest of her life or B. The guy\\'s death serves as a wake up call for Abby and she spends the rest of her life far, far away.3. Travis kills Abby and some guy in a drunken rage because he preceived a threat. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail.I don\\'t believe Travis is smart enough to get away with any of the murders because he usually doesn\\'t see any reason to hide his awful behavior. He does everything in front of many, many witnesses every single time. -I purchased this book several months ago because I planned on reading a lot of self-published books in 2012 as a reading project. I purchased it before I read the author\\'s blog post berating negative reviewers. I would not have purchased the book had the post happened before the purchase.

It wasn\\'t me being stupid and not realizing how great a book was until the second reading, like it was the first time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone and Milkweed. It really is just an awful book.Every single character in this book is an absolute idiot - with the exception of Kara, who is the only character without her head firmly shoved up her ass. Actually, she nailed Abby and Travis right on the head when she said, \"Do you know what co-dependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.\" The one damn character who wasn\\'t a total idiot - and every time she was mentioned in the book Abby made her sound like a complete bitch. Actually, I suppose Parker wasn\\'t half bad either, save for his strange (but healthy!) interest in Abby. Oh, and he liked to call her \"Abs.\" BIG FUCKING DEAL. Personally, I\\'d prefer \"Abs\" to \"Pigeon\". But besides Kara and Parker, everyone sucks.Travis is irresistible. To everyone. Absolutely everyone. Girls literally throw themselves at him in sickening, unrealistic ways, despite how motherfucking clear it is that he only wants sex. He is extremely smart and gets perfect grades but never studies at all. He doesn\\'t even bother to pay attention in his classes. Not only that, but Travis Maddox is the hottest boy on the planet. He has a perfect, mind-blowing body although he doesn\\'t work out. I\\'m sorry, but that is fucking impossible. Ask any guy with a six-pack and I\\'m sure he\\'ll tell you what hard work it is to look like that. It is also fucking impossible for a guy who never, ever works out to easily take out two members of the God damn Las Vegas mob. Travis often says stupid things that clearly indicate the relationship between himself and Abby will turn to an abusive one sooner or later - when he makes her change her clothes before they go out because he thinks what she\\'s wearing is too revealing, for instance. He is not only mentally destructive, but physically as well. He destroys his apartment when he wakes up and Abby has left him. He kicks the shit out of anyone who even looks at Abby. He breaks his fucking phone because if he doesn\\'t, he won\\'t be able to stop himself from calling Abby. THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT NORMAL.I think the most annoying thing here is that everyone acts like Travis\\' behavior is okay. It\\'s not, \"Abby, Travis is destroying the apartment. Maybe he needs to visit a psychologist and talk his dead mommy/drunken father/rambunctious older brothers problems through.\" It\\'s, \"How could you do this to him, Abby?!\" Instead of, \"Why the fuck is an asshole with anger problems breaking into song in a cafeteria?\" everyone joins him in song. Nobody, not once (besides Abby herself a few times), questions why Travis addresses Abby as Pigeon at the end of every other sentence. I know that if I heard someone addressing someone as an ugly ass bird I would question the origins of that nickname. But no. Travis calls Abby \"Pigeon\" a total of 97 times and \"Pidge\" 28. HE GETS \"PIGEON\" TATTOOED ON HIS ARM. What the fuck is this book?!Abby Abernathy just sucks because she\\'s so damn stupid. She is so dumb that although taking Travis to Vegas was the cause of their most serious breakup, she decides she wants to go back there to marry him. In what way does that make sense? You don\\'t need to fly all the way to Vegas to vow yourself into a mistake marriage, you fucking idiot. It\\'s possible to go to a courthouse. I also don\\'t really understand her rationing for needing to stay at Travis and Shepley\\'s while the water heater was broken. She can just go there, shower, and go back to her dorm. That is possible. Apparently, none of the fucking characters in Beautiful Disaster were able to reach that conclusion themselves, though.The irritating thing about Abby is that she has her moments where she\\'s so close to a breakthrough. I remember specifically one time she was telling Travis they should take their relationship more slowly (naturally, he was on the brink of flying into a rage in response). That\\'s very good. It\\'s sensible. Then a couple chapters later she runs off to Vegas to get hitched and have herself \"branded\" as \"Mrs. Maddox.\" In what world does this make sense?The bottom line is that Beautiful Disaster is a shitty book. I could go on forever about it. I could post all the completely moronic pieces of the story I highlighted while reading, but it\\'s really not worth my time. I\\'ve read it twice, and I still fucking hate the book, and I still don\\'t see at all what other readers see that is so great. Believe it or not, this is not me bashing McGuire or her readers. While McGuire hasn\\'t made the most mature comments or blog posts, I\\'m sure she\\'s really a fantastic person. While I don\\'t have a fucking clue about what people see in this book, I don\\'t think less of a person for enjoying it - and don\\'t give me reason to by attacking me and telling me why you liked it. I don\\'t care. At all. I don\\'t want to hear about your love affair with this story. I don\\'t want you to list all the great things about it. You\\'re not going to change my opinion or the opinions of others who disliked it. If you want people to gush with, go comment on a 5-star review and save your time commenting on this one. I\\'ve quit reading all the comments anyway, and skim at best. TL;DR I hate this fucking book, I feel justified in hating it now because I gave it a second chance and it was worse reading it a second time, and nobody should waste their time reading this stupid book unless they\\'re really into reading about stupid motherfuckers with such deep co-dependency issues they can\\'t even function apart. -01/14/2012:I\\'ve just realized people are actually reading, commenting, and liking this review, and I feel like I should really review this book instead of angrily rant about it. So I\\'m (very slowly) going to force myself to reread Beautiful Disaster and hopefully be able to write a better review with fewer fucks. We\\'ll see.-11/17/2011:Beautiful Disaster: a total disaster.Talk about a book with seriously messed up people who can\\'t even function by themselves. These two are worse than even Edward and Bella. Abby and Travis are two absolutely psychotic people who should never have gotten together. Beautiful Disaster glorifies everything that should be discouraged in relationships. These two people are so fucked up. It\\'s portrayed as normal that, upon waking up alone, Travis completely destroys his apartment. He has outrageous jealousy issues and instead of being freaked the fuck out by that Abby is head over heels for him. Abby continuously makes the most idiotic damn decisions. These two fuckers have so many codependency issues that they can barely even function apart. Travis needs her in the room while he\\'s beating the shit out of people or he can\\'t even concentrate on punching the guy because he\\'s so distracted wondering what she\\'s doing. He literally threatens (if not beats up) EVERY. SINGLE. GUY. that looks at Abby--and that\\'s supposed to be attractive. This shit is all viewed as normal. Travis bursting out into song in the cafeteria prompts everyone to sing along. Everyone. What in the HELL? Not to mention the random mob plot line? Or how somehow Abby is a fucking moron but is a card-playing genius? OR HOW EVERY FUCKING CHARACTER THINKS IT FINE AND DANDY THAT TRAVIS TERRORIZES THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE.How in the HELL did this get nominated for Goodreads awards? Or any award ever? How was this even PUBLISHED? This love story is not normal. Stalkers are not good. I don\\'t know what the hell all these people rating it five stars and gushing over Travis are thinking, but if I dated someone who treated me like Travis treated Abby I would run for the fucking hills as fast as I could. And, last but not least:IF I HAD TO READ THE WORD \\'PIGEON\\' ONE. MORE. TIME...

The reviews for the book were SOOO incredibly misleading. I thought Travis was going to hit her, or come close, the way everyone was going on about the 'abuse' in the book. I get it, it was intense. But having seen real abuse with my own eyes, in real life..I didnt understand what everyone else saw that made it be worse and stand apart from all other books.This is a book about an alpha male. Just because it's not a paranormal book and instead, a contemporary, it's not ok for him to act like that? I'm a pretty (very) conservative person and I've read paranormal books where the guys act worse than that.Abby was the one who got on my nerves the most throughout the book for jerking Travis around all the time. It's a book, and only a book, and I enjoyed it. I think I'll stop reading reviews before I read a book. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't want to deterred from a book again.

It\\'s as if Jamie McGuire reached into my brain, found my worst nightmare, wrote it down, and then charged me $13.99 to relive it. But that\\'s not all. I read this book on an 8-hour flight from London to Toronto. This book and I spent 8 hours together, in coach seating, with nothing to do but surrender to the impossibility of an escape. There was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, as this book stared up at me, begging to be read.\"Give me a chance,\" it said. \"Just because my author ostentatiously attacked reviewers like a spoiled brat last year during the Great War of Goodreads doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a heap of shit. Read me. Read me, bitch. Read me.\"I caved to the demands of the book, and am now a quivering wreck on the floor. I will proceed to chronicle my transition from literature enthusiast to broken shell of a woman below.Beautiful Disaster: A hallmark of passive aggressive literature that is secretly at home in the apocalyptic genreTake off: My spirits are high. The first page is fine, if a little poorly written. I make a note that this book kind of reads like fanfiction. Also making a strong effort not to blend the author\\'s tasteless actions last year with the content of the book. Also laughing at the ridiculous character names, but reminding self that neither \"America\" or \"Shepley\" is as bad as \"Eureka Boudreaux\".Growing distaste for random \"Pigeon\" nickname.Hour one: Surprised by route taken by book. There appears not to be instalove, which really shouldn\\'t be surprising, given the nature of the absolutely deplorable love interest who is a walking caricature of male privilege, misogyny and rape culture rolled into one physically unappealing package. Writing grinds on my nerves: excessive and contextless swearing, as well as random British words and phrases, pepper the text. Parker/Abby/Travis love triangle is unrealistic, twisted, and does not hang together. All Abby does is fuck Parker over, and all Travis does is fuck Abby over, and all Parker does is belittle Abby and walk around looking perfect, and no trouble stirs from this despite Travis and Parker being frat brothers? Why the fuck is Travis even in the fraternity, because all he does is beat the shit out of everyone? (Then again, this sort of antisocial clique mentality and culture of gender binary is what fraternities and sororities thrive on). Constant and aggressive misogyny against every other woman who shows interest in Travis is a motif within Abby\\'s narrative. They\\'re bimbo twins, or they\\'re short-skirted sluts, or they\\'re \"giving themselves up\". Of course, Travis engaging in promiscuous behaviour is sympathized with because he\\'s \"troubled\".Hour two: All sympathy for book waning. Abby and Travis revolve around each other like the doors at Macy\\'s and whine about loving each other but not being sure about the other person\\'s feelings, meanwhile the entire college watches them as if they are the centre of the universe and Abby shrugs off this fame while smoothing down her modest cardigan and flipping her modest hair like a \"good girl\".\"A really popular misogynist/date rapist is in love with me,\" she says, in front of an adoring freshman audience. \"But we\\'re just friends. Whatever. I don\\'t let it go to my head.\"Self-indulgent narrative sympathizes aggressively with dysfunctional central relationship and tries to convince reader that said dysfunctional central relationship is not abusive by addressing this threat of abuse through the lens of characters set up by the narrative to be villainous/bitchy/slutty. All women except those in committed relationships are portrayed as harpies. This 400-page book, narrated by a female character, written by a woman, just barely passes the Bechdel test.Hour three: Cabin fever sets in. The book and I stare each other down, with the seatbelt sign looming over our heads as a hellish omen sent to warn us of the impending five hours of the journey, in which we will remain locked in a turbulence-fuelled death grip at 40,000 feet. Determined not to succumb to the throes of insanity, I throw the book under the seat and watch Oz, The Great and Powerful. Movie is just as misogynistic and cheesy as book. Book finds its way back into my hands. I open it and go hard at it, determined to finish it in the next three hours. However, I am forced to gag into my white paper vomit bag when a sex scene with all the romantic appeal of the \"guts\" sequence from The Walking Dead blindsides me. I read another hundred or so pages filled with nothing but belly button fluff, and then the proverbial towel is thrown in again. (Bonus points for Travis trashing the apartment like a fucking gorilla in heat after Abby leaves in the morning without saying goodbye. Bonus bonus points for having Abby apologize for his appalling, violent, frightening behaviour.)Hour four: Insanity sings a siren song. I am barely able to hold on to my mind as a huge convoluted plot involving Vegas, poker and \"cronies\" springs up out of thin air. Abby and Travis break up because Travis wants to join the Mob (???), and the sun seems to shine again.Hour five: Abby and Travis fuck each other over again, constantly pussy-footing around the truth and their feelings. However, hilarity ensues when one realizes that they have broken up and Travis is stuck with \"Pigeon\" tattooed on his wrist. What a fucking idiot.(Aside: book seems to spookily endorse tattooing other people\\'s names and script related to other people\\'s names on one\\'s body. It is a very, very bad idea to tattoo another person\\'s name on your body. This is pretty much a renowned fact. Tattoo artists everywhere will strongly advise against it.)Abby and Travis fuck again in his father\\'s house (???) but they don\\'t get back together. Hour six: The plane has entered Canada and the end of the longest flight in history appears to be in sight. However, the book refuses to wrap up. There is more misogyny to be had, more violent behaviour from Travis, more pussy-footing, and a reunion which oozes with cheese. Side characters America and Shepley continue to be aggressively boring. Hour seven: weird fire-at-the-fighting-ring subplot appears, and fizzles away to nothing. Motif of weird fizzling subplots emerges and it becomes apparent that there is no plot to this book, only an abusive and codependent relationship and its hurdles. Nothing actually happens except a few immature and bratty kids behaving like dogs in heat, spattering period blood all over the floor and pissing on strangers\\' pant legs. They are the most inconvenient, self-absorbed and antagonistic group of people who all need a good, solid kick in the pants. (Bonus points for pretending to be inclusive by having a gay character. Yes, pretending. Book is not inclusive when book portrays a gay character as an extreme and commodified caricature with absolutely no expression of sexuality, no agency, and no reason for existence outside of consoling the main character when her straight romance breaks down.)Hour eight: Travis and Abby are married (!!!) in Vegas (!!!) at nineteen years old (!!!) which I suppose is meant to be a happy ending but in fact leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. Cheesiest scene in the history of the universe proceeds, along with fifty pages of surrounding filler. Book seems to drag on forever - chronicling Abby and Travis as they check in at the airport, as they drive somewhere, as they hug, and as they recycle the same conversation filled with sweet nothings that they have exchanged at least twenty times before. I am crying inside, begging for this ordeal to be over. When it is, a tsunami of relief washes over me. I arrive home, go to bed, and do not awaken for eleven hours.In conclusion: this book is not beautiful. This book is just a disaster.

In many ways this book is everything I hate in a Young Adult romance, but I still found myself enthralled, giddy, and starry eyed, regardless of how annoyed I became at time. In fact, I felt like I was at odds with myself during most of it. There was my latent teenage self, all starry eyed and idealistic, who loved everything about this book, warring with my more mature and realistic 40-year-old self who knows better. It became quite exasperating.I found I liked all the characters in this book. Not once did I become annoyed with them- shocking for a Young Adult story. The characters were multi-dimensional and authentic. I was easily transported into their world of college drama (although, frankly, it felt more like High School).Right from the start I fell head-over-heels in love with Travis. He\\'s such a lovable jerk. He epitomizes the charismatic, lackadaisical, tattooed, sexier-than-all-get-out bad boy over whom most young girls swoon. He\\'s volatile, tough, flirty, compulsive, charming, aggressive, shameless, intelligent, domineering, proud, and nonchalant. He also has a tenderhearted, kind and vulnerable side that makes it impossible not to love him. He really is the ultimate fantasy.Our book begins with Abby, our level-headed and strong-willed heroine, attending an underground college fight club where Travis \"Mad Dog\" Maddox is the undefeated champion. Unimpressed with his slick and smooth talking manner, she brushes him off, wanting nothing to do with him. Only too familiar with his type, she knows he means trouble. Travis, intrigued because Abby is immune to his charms, all but stalks her, wanting to win her over. Eventually he succeeds. What begins as a genuine friendship slowly blooms into an all consuming, passionate, and frankly, obsessive and codependent relationship.I really liked Abby\\'s character. I was braced to dislike her as the story progressed, fearing she would become little more than a doormat because of the codependent and obsessive relationship she had with Travis. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how level-headed she remained throughout the book. She confronted all of his “red flag” behaviors in a mature and rational manner, even leaving him for a time. The thing that makes this story both intriguing and appalling, is Travis\\' obsession with Abby. He is consumed by her. She becomes his everything. Exhilarating in theory; unhealthy in reality! His obsession, at times, becomes disturbing and worrisome. In the end Travis makes some behavioral changes, albeit more surface than substance, hoping to win Abby back. He succeeds, and Abby returns to the relationship. In doing so, some readers may believe in the misconception that one person can change another. While a part of me knows better I still loved so much about this book. I am a girl, after all! Would I want my 17 year old daughter to read this? No. Very few teens have either the experience or maturity to distinguish between fantasy and reality.But will I read this book again? Yes! (Oh dear, this makes me a hypocrite!)

Beautiful Disaster was a cluster eff of a read managing to throw everything I hate in a book into one novel.My first issue with this book are the characters. Our leading lady is Abby Abernathy. Then there\\'s our leading man Travis Maddox. I can capture my feels for both of them at the same time. I HATE THEM!!! I CAN\\'T STAND THEM!!!! Actually that really undersells how I feel towards them but whatever. Abby is DUMB! there is no other word I can use to describe her. I have never wanted to tear a characters hair out more than hers. She is such a plain character that turns out to be more boring than watching paint dry. It\\'s clear that the writer wanted to make it out to be that Abby would be this special snowflake but it was the fail of fails. Her sub story is that she comes from this terrible up-bringing... Even though the premise behind her tale was set up to be a success it too failed! This brings me to Travis... Oh God I don\\'t even know where to start with this this Patrick Bateman in training. This boy was two shakes of lambs tail away from cutting Abby up and making her into a skin suit. I would gladly let \"Mr. Grey see me now\" then let him touch me with a ten foot pole. He is creepy, abusive, controlling, scary, unattractive, cocky, and bizarre. This dude is beyond unstable. I also imagine him to be a mouth breather so that just adds to the growing list of reasons why I hate him. McGuire writes it so that Travis is this womanizing-college frat-man whore. Girls vagina literately bust out of their pants every time they see him. This causing me to roll my eyes so hard that they almost dislodged from my head! This leads me to problem two and three with this book. Maybe it\\'s just me (doubtful but maybe) but if I was about to hook up with a dude and I opened his bedside table and there was an endless amount of condoms and KY Jelly I would fly out of that room so fast that boy would think he was Dorthy... And if that didn\\'t make up my mind then the fact that he brings home not one, but TWO girls and sleeps with them in the living room while I\\'M IN HIS BED! would of had me never ever speaking to him again. NO GIRL IN HER RIGHT MIND WOULD HAVE SWEPT THAT UNDER THE RUG! The scene made me want to vomit then drink the cleaning products under my sink. Travis has major bipolar, drinking, jealousy, and personality issues. Travis also manages to keep Jesus abs the whole time without ever working out... This is even mentioned SEVERAL times in the book! HA NO! My fourth issue is the \"love triangle\"... It slightly reflected the same way the one from Twilight did, as in it was pointless. You never once think that Bella\\'s not going to choose Edward. Never once did you think. \"Wow Jacob might actually win the girl\", No! that doesn\\'t happen! Why this B would choose the travesty that is Travis over the handsome pre-doctor gentlemen is beyond me... Again, Maybe that\\'s just me. On to issue five, NO GUY NO GUY EVER!!!! WITH ANY AMOUNT OF PRIDE, STANDARDS, OR EVEN ONE WITH HALF A BRAIN WOULD LET THE GIRL THEY ARE COURTING SLEEP IN THE BED WITH ANOTHER MAN. You\\'re telling me that you still want to take this girl on a date even though she is living with another man and laying in bed with him every night (no the pre-doc wasn\\'t clueless to these acts)?!?!?! YOU STILL THOUGHT SHE\\'D END UP WITH YOU?!?! Please GTFOOH! No, there\\'s no way I\\'m believing this. I also don\\'t believe Abby could be dangling these two dudes by their balls when they both openly know she is bouncing between them like that white ball in a game of pong. Nope, again I just can\\'t! My sixth issue is the plot. It\\'s all over the place. It\\'s one spotty scene after another of Travis trying to dick measure with any and every guy. Once I heard this dude had tribal tattoos and was in an underground fight club (did I fail to mention this, YEAH HE IS IN A POOR EXCUSE FOR A FIGHT CLUB!!!) I should have known to put this book down... HMMMM TRAVIS I HATE TO BREAK IT TOO YOU BUT YOU ARE NO BRAD PITT. I also struggled to remember if this was high school or college... They had a set freaking lunch time!!! Did no one else catch that?! Oh and the fact that Travis kept beating the snot out of people with NO repercussions! WHERE THE EFF WAS THE PRINCIPAL DEAN??? OH and don\\'t get me started on the whole high-school musical sing along thing. (Seriously, what the hell did I just read?) No just No!My seventh and I think final issue (JK I could probably go on for days) with this book are the sub-characters. America is the worst best friend in history of friends. Shep is the worst family member in the history of the world. The only character that I thought made any sense was Kara!! She was the only character I liked. I kept screaming \"THANK YOU!\" every time she spoke! \"Do you know what codependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.\"Why Abby kept blowing her off also blew my mind.There were just so many things I couldn\\'t get behind. I know that the great part about books are that they can be anything. That they can go anywhere real or unrealistic. But this was just to far from either. I just can\\'t really get over how much I disliked everything about this book. The characters, weak. The plot, weaker. The romance, the weakest.Whatever walking deads on so I\\'m over this.

I\\'m imagining I\\'ve raised a few eyebrows with beginning this review on that note. You might be thinking \"Well, aren\\'t you being a little melodramatic, Rose? It\\'s just a book - it can\\'t possibly be that bad, right?\"*exhales slowly* Let me state for the record I\\'m a person who likes reading many different kinds of romances because I\\'m an avid reader and genres know no bounds with me, for the most part. I hesitated reading \"Beautiful Disaster\" because I was informed of issues with the book long before I picked up the e-galley and took the task of reading it in full.Books that glorify abusive relationships, especially if it\\'s veiled abuse and doesn\\'t give proper context nor knocks down the manipulative behavior, do not sit well with me. Nor do those that champion misogynistic ideals and present women in a negative light. Granted, as I mentioned before, I like a good romantic read. I also like books that deal with tough subjects and push the envelope when it comes to tackling a tough subject matter. I don\\'t mind those things, especially if they leave me with things to think about long after I\\'ve turned the last page of the book. Developed, rounded characters in the mix are a bonus as well. Prior to reading this book - what I\\'d read of Travis was that he\\'s a condescending, patronizing, controlling jerk who gets away with a lot in this book. (I could describe him in more crude terms, but I\\'m trying to keep that at a minimum in this reflection.) And it\\'s not necessarily knocked down by the passive heroine who actually does have another guy who cares about her and treats her well, but the portrayal is never equivocated because all the while, Travis comes up as the obvious horse in the love triangle race. If one could even call it a true triangle. And the heroine never focuses on the wrong that Travis does, but rather focuses on all the other external elements (other women, etc.) as being wrong.I could open the floor and ask a simple question: why do people find personalities like Travis to be romantic? I ask that question sincerely in a manner of discourse, because I don\\'t understand the attracting factor of someone who would go to such lengths to control what a woman wears, who she sees, where she resides, and practically throw a fit if she deviates from those restrictions. People argue that Travis is not abusive, but there are more dimensions to abuse than just physical context (despite the fact that he tears up a room in response to the heroine\\'s actions in one scene of the book). What little I had skimmed in BD\\'s snippets and also read in other reviews had abuse of another sort - mental and emotional. The heroine keeps being drawn back into Travis\\'s influence, though it\\'s clear on several counts that there are moments when she wants to get the heck away from him, but then turns around and commends his behavior in implied gestures. It\\'s not made okay by the fact that Travis starts singing in the middle of a certain setting \"I Can\\'t Get No Satisfaction\" or the fact that he buys her a puppy. He might have moments of good, but the larger impressions of the novel were that his influence is negative and the heroine desires him in light of that negativity.That was the initial reason why I passed on this book for content rationale. My experience with McGuire\\'s first novel in her \"Providence\" trilogy didn\\'t sit well with me either. But curiosity has never let me lie in peace when it comes to a book. So when I saw this available as an e-galley, I decided to swallow my qualms and go for it.The experience was worse than I\\'d initially believed it to be. There has been debate with this novel as a self-published work as to what genre it fell under, given its respective thematic and the frank content of Abby and Travis\\' relationship. McGuire herself had stated that it was once a mature YA title (which I would adamantly refute given the strong language, sexual, and discretionary content of the book). It\\'s been since marketed as an adult contemporary romance.There\\'s also a question that I think might raise a few other eyebrows that I\\'m going to explore: Is it really a romance novel? The knee-jerk reaction might be akin to: \"Of course it\\'s a romance novel! What else would it be? It\\'s showing a dysfunctional relationship between two trainwreck lovers who are meant to be together and weather all kinds of hardships and such to ultimately be one.\"I\\'ll give a single initial argument though - just as food for thought. When the dysfunction becomes more than the love, where is the line drawn between it being a romance or a staged drama in prose form? It\\'s true that people do crazy things when in love and act in the veil of desperation - sometimes going through something akin to the five stages of grief before coming to terms with the heart of their true sentiments (and there\\'s plenty of that to go around in this book). Yet when it becomes so manufactured that the people inside the story don\\'t act in the way that the character would act given their personality traits and knowledge in the book, and the author\\'s obviously playing the puppeteer strings to skew it to a certain result, it can make the experience sour faster than week-old milk. And while I would say in romance literature, many may see the experience as escapist...manufacturing a storyline to milk its drama doesn\\'t do anyone any favors.Which is why I wasn\\'t buying what \"Beautiful Disaster\" sold.Abby Abernathy is a college freshman who meets Travis \"Mad Dog\" Maddox at a fighting match in which he\\'s a participant. To say their relationship gets off to a rocky start would be an understatement. Abby\\'s quick to push him away because of his reputation, perception of his tattoos, and perceived sexual promiscuity. And Travis, bad boy extraordinaire, can\\'t help but be drawn to Abby in her innocence and challenge to shove him away. Their relationship is further drawn together since they know people in the same circles. Abby\\'s friend America (Mare) and America\\'s boyfriend, Shep, are just two examples. America has to be the most inconsistent best friend I\\'ve read, because she goes back and forth between passionately wanting Abby to be a part of Travis\\'s life and thinking Abby is the only one who can \"right\" him, and also thinking it\\'s best if Abby stays the heck away before she gets hurt.Suffice to say, in the course of the story, Abby and Travis have a lot of on-again/off-again relations. That normally wouldn\\'t bother me in a romance novel. It happens even in real life. Given the context of this novel, however, I was horrified and made numb by it.Abby is a passive heroine crafted in the guise of proactive by her incendiary attitudes towards Travis. There\\'s really very little to no background given on her to round her character. It took me five chapters to realize what she was studying at her college, let alone a good bit of the novel to know anything about her family (and when that comes to light, it\\'s fairly reminiscent of McGuire\\'s other, latter penned novel \"Providence\" - heroine has father issues, father\\'s associated with criminal activity, etc.) I think that disconnect was what made it hard to truly sympathize with her, aside from some harrowing moments where she\\'s desperately getting away from her relationship with Travis and facing some antagonism from other sources (a near rape, a fire, etc.).Travis - again, I do not understand why he\\'s a desirable male lead. He takes on the typical \"bad boy who\\'s hurting\" trope, and while I actually do tend to like alpha males who are in pain and sometimes lash out for genuine reasons, Travis never has any kind of development to justify his actions, let alone does he face the repercussions of them. It\\'s clear he has issues like his boiling anger, propensity to hit anything that gets in his way or offends \"his girl,\" and some jarring examples of insensitivity to anyone but himself and his needs. There are moments penned where it\\'s made to seem like he\\'s being cute, but the majority of the time he\\'s creepy, clingy, needy, and self-absorbed. There\\'s a false guise of self-awareness given in the book when he acknowledges to Abby that he\\'s \"messed up\", but never seems to learn from his actions. There\\'s a part of me that wondered if he was suffering from (and I\\'m being very serious here) a mental disorder that made him as such. It would\\'ve been helpful if maybe McGuire had the insight to delve into that part of his character more, but it never shows. Not once. Travis\\'s actions are often glorified and made okay by Abby\\'s abrupt about face. No expansion given.Examples? Here are some:He walks into the bathroom one scene while she showers. Abby\\'s horrified one moment and then suddenly finds the gesture cute.He calls her Pidge - it\\'s given as a nickname (which she isn\\'t initially affectionate toward) and is supposedly a reference to the Disney film Lady and the Tramp, but that\\'s never given in the context of the book. Very rarely does he allude to her real name, and when he does, it\\'s often to mock her or mock someone else discussing her (with the effect of guilt tripping her).He totals his apartment after Abby leaves the day after a bet they made together expires (requiring her to stay at his place for a month). They just so happened to have sex the night before, and she leaves the next morning without telling him. She\\'s blamed by pretty much everyone that she was the cause of his tantrum and she accepts it.Travis also gets desperate and chases her back home after a stint in Vegas and wanting to fight there for a mobster in order to obtain money. Abby\\'s upset by it because her father was involved in that line of work and she doesn\\'t want to go through the hurt and pain she endured from her father\\'s involvements. Travis tries to restrain her, storms into the apartment with her roommate, and she has to hide from him until he \"calms down.\"How is that love? How is that respect?There are other factors to consider here as well. Let\\'s take it from the perspective of the man who, for a time, is set to be the \"other\" love interest in this novel. Meet Parker - a high achieving, Med-school aspiring student who seems like a nice guy, even if he seems like a bit of a Gary Stu initially considering his wealth and intelligence (and the diamond bracelet gift does seem a bit presumed as Abby\\'s birthday gift for the duration of their initial relationship). But one can tell he\\'s genuinely attracted to Abby - he treats her well, is even patient when he\\'s sidelined by her. You can\\'t help but feel bad for this guy after a point because he\\'s pretty much a pawn in the \"Travis and Abby\" show. It\\'s not a real love triangle because, where Parker\\'s in the picture, either Abby, Parker himself, or someone else brings Travis up as the topic of conversation/comparison. It\\'s not realistic. What frustrated even more is that I felt McGuire\\'s authorial voice often intruded with the relations between Abby and Parker where Travis was used as the comparison. It was as if it were set up to failure from point one. The way Abby treats Parker broke my heart, because either there\\'s a hateful comment he makes that\\'s decidedly out of character (and McGuire\\'s intruding voice) in an attempt to make Travis look like the better guy, or there\\'s a point where Travis or Abby completely skewer the guy for trying to use reason, or for just being who he is.The only two characters I can say I actually liked consistently through the work were Finch and Kara, though their respective roles were very small in the overarching novel.The events of the novel themselves are problematic, but let me take a moment to discuss the writing and thematic. (I mentioned misogyny in this novel, so I\\'ll go a bit into it as well here.) It\\'s one of those reads that can be quickly digested, but it\\'s poorly written. Awkward dialogue tags (other than \"said\" or \"asked\"), stilted dialogue, choppy phrasing - all things that could\\'ve been avoided with thorough editing. The thematic of this book bothered me considering the misogynistic language that\\'s prevalent in this. If not just for the events themselves (i.e. Travis dropping a woman from his lap after she insults Abby or Travis saying that he wouldn\\'t want his future daughter to open her legs for a man so easily), then the language left something to be desired with frequent slut shaming, causal throws of \"bitches\" and \"hos\" and such. I\\'m not a stranger to crude language in a work, but some of these were championed for obvious humor purposes, and they didn\\'t come across as humorous or realistic at all to me.So, in sum, I think \"Beautiful Disaster\" didn\\'t contain much beauty to it at all. I\\'ll end on the note that after reading the book, I see the symbolism of the cover with a butterfly being kept in a jar. The sad thing about is that, when you think about the image in a sense, a romanticized version of it may mean that it\\'s beauty captured and contained from the rest of the world. But the reality, the longer that butterfly is contained from its habitat and not left to wander free to experience the world, it suffocates, withers, and dies. I think that Abby and Travis\\'s relationship is, indeed, a suffocating presence that doesn\\'t have any true romantic notions at all, and I deign to think it represents anything that could be construed as healthy or desirable.Overall score: 0.5/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher S&S/Atria Books.

No Spoilers. The book Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire has been all around the Blogosphere lately. It became available on Netgalley and many bloggers are currently reading it. This book has caused many controversy and has earned some really nasty reviews, still, the book has an average rating of 4.13. I recently stumbled upon a review that said very very no-so-nice things about Beautiful Disaster, and it also mentioned that everyone that rated this book with 5 stars was a @%#^&!#$% and insane. Well Hello! I\\'m a @%#^&!#$% and apparently also insane because I gave the book 5 Fat Stars. So sue me.And now I am taking the time to make a second review for Beautiful Disaster explaining why I think this book was great and why I don\\'t think it was a book encouraging abusive relationships and blah blah. REVIEW OF BEAUTIFUL DISASTER - TAKE TWO. *Scroll Down for my original review of Beautiful DisasterI\\'m picking up my sword and helmet because I know lots of people won\\'t agree with me. Anyways, here I go. *deep breath**Point One - Travis is an abusive and violent asshole.I disagree. Yes, there is a scene in the book where he trashes his place because of a few situations with Abby where she left and lots of drama. Yes, that was violent but I don\\'t think it was completely and utterly scandalous. Some guys tend to break or hit things when they\\'re angry, NOT people. I have 3 older brothers; One of them would always, always hit a wall when he was angry, hence, he always had a broken wrist. One of my other brothers would simply go to his room in silence and do nothing but stay dead silent, he would shut down. I cried, and Yelled to my pillow, and cried some more. My mom throws things at people, I\\'m not even kidding, every time mom got angry we all just yelled \"Duck!\" luckily she always missed - I still Love you mom! - So maybe Travis\\'s way of releasing stress wasn\\'t the best and maybe it was a bit over the top and you would consider it violent, but he never, EVER was violent towards Abbey in the book. Ever.*Point Two - The Abusive and Twisted relationship of Travis and Abby.Their relationship was probably not the best of the world. It was, in fact, a Disaster. And the author knows it and she mentions it in the book and wrote it in the title.“It\\'s dangerous to need someone that much. You\\'re trying to save him and he\\'s hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\" I smiled at the ceiling. \"It doesn\\'t matter what or why it is. When it\\'s good, Kara... it\\'s beautiful.”-Beautiful DisasterI don\\'t think that the Author - or anyone for that matter, would ever encourage an abusive relationship. EVER. Abby and Travi\\'s relationship is very very far from perfect, but the beauty in it is that they both become the best versions of themselves when being together, and I think that\\'s what relationships are all about: being with someone that inspires you to be better each and every day.“You know why I want you? I didn’t know I was lost until you found me. I didn’t know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You’re the one thing I’ve got right. You’re what I’ve been waiting for\"-Beautiful DisasterYou are not supposed to enter into a relationship thinking the other person can save you or that you can save the other person. Because, eventually, if you think you\\'re doing the saving, you\\'ll probably realize that it\\'s not possible and they\\'ll become a weight on your shoulder. If you think you can be saved by the other, you\\'ll realize no one can really save you but yourself. In the first quote mentioned, Travis thinks he can be save and, guess what? the relationship fails. It isn\\'t until BOTH of them deal with their issues and learn their lessons that they get back together. And they are still not perfect, because perfection does not exist.*Point Three - The JealousyTravis is a very jealous guy. This is what I think about Jealousy:“A person shows signs of clutching on too fast, of being needy, of not hearing the word \"no,\" of jealousy, of guarding you and your freedom. But the signs can be so small they skitter right past you. Sometimes they dance past, looking satiny, something you should applaud. Someone\\'s jealousy can make you feel good. Special. But it\\'s not even about you. It\\'s about a hand that is already gripping. It\\'s about their need, circling around your throat”- Deb Caletti, StayNo one could have said it better than Deb Caletti. Huge HUGE flaw in Travis, and I\\'ll say it again: the relationship fails until he\\'s able to pull his shit together. *Point Four - A Bad Book.This book will never be at a Shakespeare lever, that\\'s for sure, but it\\'s not a bad book with bad messages to YA readers. I think the exact opposite. The author made this story for a reason, made the characters that way for a reason, and gave the book that title for a reason. And I honestly think that when you place everything together, aside from being a good entertaining story, this book turns out to be genius in a quiet way. I really did get a lot of things out of this book, and I know that many many of you won\\'t share the same thoughts and feelings with me, and that\\'s perfectly normal, we\\'re not the same and we don\\'t think the same way. But I definitely felt the need to explain this because I don\\'t like the assumptions they are making of us Beautiful Disaster Lovers. Now I wave my 5 star flag with pride because this book - in my eyes - earned every single one of them. And I shall be forever grateful to Jennifer from Some Like It Paranormal and Header from Nightly Reading for insisting on me reading this book.and now going back to fan-girl mode: OH MY GOD!!! I Cannot wait for Walking Disaster!!!! Which is Beautiful Disaster told in Travis POV!!! *SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAL* MY FIRST REVIEW OF BEAUTIFUL DISASTER. This book was so good, so so so good! and the ending was so Incredibly Happy and Good that it seemed unrealistic....Let me explain my situation: I\\'m sure we\\'ve all had a friend when we were young that was in a relationship and swore they were going to get married and you were like \"Pfft, yeah right, you\\'ll break up eventually, you\\'ll see.\" Something similar happened with me and this book, I was like \"Pfft, yeah right, nobody gets such a happy ending. Pfft.\" Which really pisses me off! I used to be a hopeless romantic and now I\\'ve become un-romantic and disgustingly realistic. and it\\'s not even realistic because Happy endings DO exist. We\\'re just all too blind to see them. Society killed good romance and Happily Ever After But then I got to talking with lovely BF Jennifer from Some Like It Paranormal and I was ranting about how I was such a pessimist and she said [Quote] \"Yeah I\\'m a big pessimist but I love my HEA! I don\\'t care how unrealistic, an author should end things nicely otherwise I\\'m all upset and can\\'t eat dinner!\" So Screw being a pessimist! Screw it I say! I will enjoy this Happy Ending and give this book the 5 Stars it Deserves! It was a great and addicting story! I Loved it! and I want One Just like it! [well, we can keep a few situations out, I guess] The story was full of great elements, for example Abby mentions she has a troubled past, but you will never come close to guessing what she\\'s running away from, I was very surprised and pleased when I found out, not your average situation. Moving on to Travis: Swoon worthy guy [Duh] Strong, with Tattoos and trouble trouble trouble. He was way to jealous at times for my taste and very violent [though never towards Abby] also very much of a jerk at times but, you can see he tries really hard to be better, which gives him bonus points. Abby was also driving me nuts at times, BOTH of them drove me nuts during the book, they were perfect for each other and they were both too stupid to see it, but it was never annoying and it only made me want to read faster! Spoiler Note, if you haven\\' read the book don\\'t you dare see it! it\\'ll ruin a really cool/cheesy/stupid part in the book! (view spoiler)[When he gets a tattoo with her name seemed stupid to me, waaaaaay beyond the valley of sanity. also when she gets one at the end.... Still, it was pretty cheesy/corny/stupid and I liked it x) also I love the ending when she reminds him never to bet against her, I really do think that gave the book a nice guarantee that they will get a happily ever after. After all, you simply don\\'t bet against Lucky 13 ;) (hide spoiler)]In conclusion: this book was Incredible. And the title could not describe it better, it\\'s a Beautiful Disaster, because even though their relationship was, well, a Disaster, it was still Beautiful, Travis being the best version of himself he could be when he was with Abby, wanting to be the right guy and making the right choices, and Abby learning to take chances and also that sometimes life has other plans for you, and that this plans are often the best choice. An Amazing book that it\\'s worth keeping and re-reading. You won\\'t forget it.

I actually believe this may be the worst book I have ever read. The characters are poorly developed, the writing style just appalling, I never really understood their motivations and the narrative never gave them time to react to situations. This felt like it had been written by a twelve year old to me.This takes place over 2 semesters at college. Travis is a manwhore student who earns his money by bare knuckle fighting. He treats women terribly - very much wham bam thank you ma'am and kick her out the door 2 seconds later. Inexplicably, the moment he sees Abby, he falls in love and calls her pigeon - a rather scabby rodent like bird. Abby has a past she wants to escape - her Father was a successful poker player whose luck ran out when Abby turned 13 and so he hates her now! I soooo didn't get that either. The characters make decisions that just had me all WTF?? It just doesn't make any sense. It's possibly the worst character development I have ever seen in a novel. Anyway, the story stumbles from situation to situation - Travis is goofily in love and will savagely beat any guy that looks at Abby sideways. We have descriptions of him holding someone on the floor and repeatedly smashing his fist in their face more than once. That's not protective - that's downright violent and could actually result in a serious brain injury. And this is aimed at a YA readership with Travis cast as a 'hero'?? WTF?The sex scene where Travis takes Abby's virginity is absolutely forgettable. I know she begs for it but he just ruts away on top of her with no thoughts of her pleasure or even preparing her to make it easier for her. He's pretty shit in bed to be fair and I was quite shocked he didn't have more pride in his performance given that he's had so much experience.Travis appears to be harbouring some serious schizophrenic tendencies - perhaps he has actually sustained a serious brain injury in one of those fights? That might well explain his truly ridiculous character and decisions and reactions to situations - or could that possibly be just do to the poor character development on behalf of this writer. Travis is not one of the good guys. He is not a hero. There is nothing endearing about his character at all. He is one of those nasty, jealous, possessive, violent guys that will beat the supposed love of his life senseless just because she glances at another man or he glances at her. Abby's future is likely to be fraught with peril, on edge constantly with what Travis will think about what she is wearing, who she is talking to and what she is doing. She will be so scared of upsetting him, it will totally rule her life. Someone needs to tell Abby to get out and to get out quick before he beats her to a pulp because he surely will. I fully accept f*cked up characters in books but this guy is written as a 'hero' and he is aimed at the YA audience. Horrific!! To think that a girl of Abby's age could think that Travis is some kind of romantic hero is pretty scary and a pretty appalling message to be sending out to this book's target demographic. I'm real sorry that I didn't get this - I can see that this story is so well loved by so many here but it really wasn't for me. To this day I just cannot even begin to understand why so many people here that I respect have given it 5 stars. What in the world do you all see here that I just can't? It completely baffles me. It's not even halfway good. I'd like to add that it's really not often that I leave reviews like this but I felt so strongly that this book is sending THE most appalling message of accepting violent tossers as heroes to it's young readers that I felt compelled to speak out against it. \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/265410318?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Aestas Book Blog', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog', 'Sep 08, 2011', 'it was amazing', '223', \" “I need to hear you say it. I need to know you’re mine.”“I’ve been yours since the second we met.” ooooo *sigh* what can I say about this book except that its reeeeally good, HIGHLY addictive and utterly captivating. You literally feel compelled to keep turning the pages. You just can't stop. No joke!Abby and Travis meet in college. He's a tough, charming, insanely hot, tattooed badboy who also is a womanizing A student who fights in a ring at night and once he meets Abby, he's just captivated by her. Abby is a good girl, no drinking, no swearing, pretty much just his complete opposite. Despite their differences, they are somehow drawn to each other other. “I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn’t something about you at all. It was just you.” He makes a deal with her where if he can remain abstinent for a month, she has to live with him for a month. They become friends before they become lovers but its clear that they are meant to be together. Travis thinks to highly of Abby to initially be with her. He doesn't feel worthy of her. And in the book, we get to watch that change as it becomes more and more impossible for them to not be together. “To douchebags!” he said, gesturing to Brad. “And to girls that break your heart,” he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. “And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her.”Its weird, there were a lot of things in this story that normally bother me a little, but for whatever reason, I just loved it here. I couldn't get enough of this book!I fell in love with how fiercely protective Travis was of Abby. He may have gone overboard a few times but it made me totally swoony! This is a book after all, and in books we accept things that may not work in real life but that, in a story context, just make your heart race! “You can’t tell me what to do anymore, Travis! I don’t belong to you!” In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. “WELL I BELONG TO YOU!” The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch. He looked at my lips, panting. “I belong to you.” I loved Travis' character. He was flawed, oh so flawed, but his heart was in the right place. I love a guy who is sure of who he loves, not afraid to defend them, and will try as hard as he can to prove himself.This book is fast paced and action packed. There are no slow or dull points. The writing is smooth and sucks you right into the story - puts you right there with the characters. It is heart racing and heart breaking and has a HEA. “-It’s over. Go home.-You’re my home.” I loved watching the journey that the characters went through - watching Travis change and become a better person, watching Abby come to terms with her past and watching the two of them fall head over heals in love. I'm unfortunately writing this review months after I originally read the book but all I know is that this book is sitting on my favs shelf and will definitely be re-read at some point. I'd definitely call this a MUST read for any fan of badboy romances.Here's how I see Travis & Abby (ps, I know Travis is supposed to have a buzz-cut so lets just mentally shave the hair on the guy on the top right cuz I love the look of him for Travis despite the slightly longer hair lol):For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog Facebook Page \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/206653134?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Torie', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2313749-torie', 'Jul 03, 2011', 'really liked it', '213', ' WARNING: THIS BOOK IS LIKE CRACK Because you feel like such shit for reading it, but you can\\'t stop yourself from reading it anyway. There were more typos than I could count, the dialogue is just so cheesy it\\'s cringe-worthy, the boy is such a Gary-Sue, BUT...oh my Lord I could NOT stop myself. I was so grossed out by myself for liking it, my boyfriend was grossed out by me liking it, but I couldn\\'t pull myself away! The Issues The boy is a character OBVIOUSLY conjured by a woman and a HUGE Gary Sue! He\\'s a bad-boy that\\'s superb at fighting, but he\\'s still a genius that doesn\\'t have to work towards school. How convenient! No one can beat him at a fight and no girl can pass him without shamelessly throwing herself at him. The only flaw he really seems to have is his inability to control his anger and his violent tendencies (which apparently make him all the more appealing), but other than that, he\\'s pretty peachy keen. He has a sob story, which isn\\'t really all that sad, but McGuire was trying to fault him somewhere--anywhere--and his lack of a mother seemed good enough. He says all the right things, that are so incredibly cheesy, and it makes me wince every time I read them.The girl is a special little snowflake. I didn\\'t really hate her, and I didn\\'t quite love her, but since I was saddled with her, I chose to quietly accept her as a narrator. Her decisions were so stupid sometimes and so ridiculous, that it was unbelievable. Like, I wanted to hit her and say, \"Really? Why are you such a wuss? Why are you so weak? Why do you keep running?\" Her sob story wasn\\'t really that sad either, but I guess EVERYONE has to have a sad backstory in this tale. Ugggh. I did not sympathize with her at all. It was such an absurd sob story that I like really could care less. The cliches run so rampant throughout the book! The only girl who refuses the sexy bad boy is the one he wants the most. Why? I don\\'t know! Nothing really stands out about her other than she wears short dresses and gets drunk a lot. I guess that\\'s hot for boys. I\\'ll take note! If a boy hits on you, try to repel him by being bitchy, ugly, and distant and he will LOVE YOU even if he denies everyone else! The foil to the boy was horribly developed. He did not prove a strong antagonist because all Abby would describe him as is \"rich, cute and charming,\" so we don\\'t really learn much about him other than that. Like, what are we going to do with the fact that he\\'s going to go to Harvard?? It\\'s too obvious that he\\'s supposed to be the polar opposite of Travis\\' \"wrong side of the tracks\" lifestyle (and supposedly the right choice for Abby), and therefore makes it too obvious who she\\'s going to choose. Why I loved it anyway The narrator was annoying, but she wasn\\'t THAT bad. Sometimes I enjoyed her quips, and I sure as hell enjoyed the smutty scenes (Mcguire, you sure can write some good smut!), but what I really loved were the supporting characters. Loved America! Though, to be completely honest, I\\'ve never heard of a blonde girl named America before. I love when girls actually have supportive girl friends rather than destructive ones. It\\'s a refreshing change and I loved it. Shep was really minor and off to the side, so I can\\'t really talk about him since he just pops in when it\\'s convenient. I like the whole fighting idea and some of the plot turns were really fun to read. Travis may have been a Gary Sue, but aside from all the CHEESINESS he oozed, you get to like some of the stuff he says and does. But seriously, SO MUCH CHEESE. THE DIALOGUE MADE ME WANT TO CLAW MY EYES OUT. UGH.Still, I enjoyed it and I absolutely hate myself for it.

He looked at his guest and then patted her backside.\"My company\\'s here. You\\'d better go.\"She smiled and wrapped her arms around him, kissing his neck. \"I\\'ll leave my number on the counter.\"\"Eh…don\\'t worry about it,\" Travis said in a casual tone.\"What?\" she asked, leaning back to look in his eyes.\"Every time!\" America said. She looked at the woman. \"How are you surprised by this? He\\'s Travis Fucking Maddox! He is famous for this very thing, and every time they\\'re surprised!\" and this is from girl who still wants her best friend and travis to be together. some friend. a sane person would automatically eliminate him from the dating-pool.3) will not take these women into his room or bed - he sleeps with them on the couches in the communal area of the apartment. dude, people have to sit on those to watch t.v.! it is just selfish and discourteous to the people with whom you live, and it is a very telling indication of your lack of respect for your conquests.4) childish displays of displeasure like travis trashing his room after abby leaves without saying goodbye. again - i understand how this can translate into a mystique of uncontrolled emotions and exciting dangerous elements, but it\\'s just - no. use your words, travis.5) emotionally underdeveloped and erratic. before abby, travis was all love-\\'em-and-leave-\\'em with this very studied and disingenuous posturing. not a spoiler, but a long passage that you may or may not want to read:(view spoiler)[Travis stood behind the breakfast bar, crossed his arms over his chest, and smiled. \"What\\'s wrong, Pidge?

What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?\"\"My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let\\'s put it that way.\"I crossed my arms, angry that he\\'d made sense. \"So, besides admitting that you\\'re a jackass, you\\'re saying that because she slept with you, she deserved to be tossed out like a stray cat?\"\"I\\'m saying that I was honest with her. She\\'s an adult, it was consensual…she was a little too eager about it, if you want to know the truth. You act like i committed a crime.\"\"She didn\\'t seem as clear about your intentions, Travis.\"Women usually justify their actions with whatever they make up in their heads. She didn\\'t tell me up front that she expected a relationship any more than I told her I expected sex with no strings. How is it any different?\"\"You\\'re a pig.\"Travis shrugged. \"I\\'ve been called worse.\" (hide spoiler)]SO many things wrong with that passage. SO many. and this scene is exactly one page before that walking in on her in the shower scene, where he goes through her luggage and brings her the things he thinks she will need for her ablutions. and despite that explosive scene THAT JUST HAPPENED, her reaction to this is, after the initial reasonable reaction of \"get the fuck out, you perv,\" is He was thoughtful and almost nice when he wanted to be.which is moronic, but the point is that even though he has lived that casual sex lifestyle and been disgusted by the women who put out \"too eagerly,\" once he and abby get together and he becomes the redeemed beast to her beauty, he becomes soooo clingy. which - once a woman has foolishly succumbed to your bad-boy charm, is a complete bait-and-switch, and no one wants that, even without all the other bullshit.6) evidence of protection or no, sleeping with a different woman every night of the week is just a dangerous guy to hook up with. 7) watching her sleep. again, this is excusable once a relationship has been established, but when people are platonically sharing a bed, it is uncomfortable at best.i realize i have not gone into much plot detail, so some of this probably makes no sense, but i\\'m already afraid i am going to exceed the space allotted to write this review (or response) and i figure most people bothering to read this have either 1) read the book or 2) have already made up their minds not to, so it\\'s what i\\'m doing. other bullshit things travis does:vagblocking abby\\'s flirtations with other men while being himself a manwhore, like bringing home two women one evening to intercourse while abby is waiting for him in the bedroom, is unacceptable. right, because it\\'s other guys who treat women poorly and he\\'s just looking out for her best interests.taking drinks out of her hand and throwing themtelling her to change before they go out in public because he doesn\\'t want other men looking at her when she is looking sexy. again - they are not together at this point. oh, and she changes. dumbass.dragging her out of a car when she comes home from a date with another guy\"Why did you do that?\" I asked.\"Why? Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!\" he yelled. His eyes were unfocused, and I could see he was incapable of rational conversation.I kept my voice calm. \"I may be staying with you, but what I do, and who I do it with is my business.\" He flicked his cigarette to the ground. \"You\\'re so much better than that, Pidge. Don\\'t let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.\"right. let him fuck you on a couch. is classier. god, none of these characters have any self-awareness. travis in this and other scenes, and abby in most of her scenes. there\\'s a lot of this:why do people think i am dating travis?? is it because we walk around campus holding hands or with our arms around each other and he has stopped flirting with/bedding other girls and i sleep in his bed?? that\\'s just because we are friends! and i lost a bet!! i can\\'t believe everyone is talking about me like i am a slut just because i sleep in one guy\\'s bed while publicly dating another boy. i\\'m a virgin for goodness\\' sake! and i don\\'t like it when women say bad things about other women (me), even though i have spent most of the book judging the girls that travis beds and calling them clueless bimbos. i\\'m a virgin with a virgin\\'s disdain for other women\\'s expressive sexualities but no one has the right to talk about me even though i am behaving like a complete tease. (not an actual quote, but an unauthorized synopsis)in college, sure, i slept in many beds of boys and girls platonically, and not because of any bet, but because it was all innocent puppy-piling after raves or parties or whatever (feel free to just glide over the word \"rave.\") but never with someone i knew was into me, because i am not cruel, and i never embraced that casual nudity thing, while these two act like a long-married couple in this weird sexless domestic arrangement and then act surprised when something is made of it in gossipville.more bad behavior:dragging her away from a date in order to drag her to one of his fights because he needs her there. \"no, parker, we are not involved, but imma just leave this date you are paying for to go watch this guy with a reputation for sexing every girl beat some guy bloody for money, mmkay?? call me!\" (again, not an actual quote)throwing her over his shoulder and forcibly removing her from a party, throwing her in a car, dragging her home, coming very close to taking her virginity (consensually it must tragically be noted) even though she is seeing someone else, but then - is too sensitive even in his drunken lust (mcguire wants you to read it as \"love\") and so all the before with the manhandling and kidnapping is erased/forgiven.forbidding her to leave his house when she asks him to let her out of the terms of the bet. because she has principles, and she can\\'t just welsh on a bet, even if it becomes potentially dangerous and is ruining her relationshipswaiting for her at the front door when she is out on dates, opening it as soon as she arrives to i guess establish dominance and prevent that goodnight kiss?He leaned in, seeming flustered. \"I\\'ll kill him if he touches you.\"\"I like him,\" I said, emphasizing each word.He seemed stunned at my confession and then his features turned severe. \"Fine. If he ends up holding you down in the backseat of a car, don\\'t come crying to me.\"again, because other men are threats to women.beating someone up on abby\\'s tacit commandsaying things like: \"I\\'ll end up in prison if I hear you slept with someone else.\"that whole cafeteria scene where he jumps on the table and sings and everyone joins him in song like he\\'s some hero even though this is the same cafeteria where he unceremoniously dumped a girl from his lap who smart-mouthed america (the character, not the country) and beat a boy severely who smart-mouthed abby. again - deal-breaker for 1) embarrassing and foolish public display and 2) manic episode contrasted with violent episodes a huge red flag for bizarre impulsive behavior.getting a tattoo of abby\\'s name. or the (stupid) nickname he chose for her at first sight. okay, this is hypocritical for me to point out as a warning sign because i have one, and i got it about nine months into the relationship, because he was hurt that i was going to see an ex\\'s show, so on the way to the show, i popped into a place that advertised \"haircuts and tattoos\" and got a tattoo of his name on my marriage-finger, and when i got home and showed it to him, he was understandably freaked out, because who does that? but he was pleased at the gesture. story told to show that: people do stupid things when they are young, and jealousy can be normal and rational and not lead to broken mirrors. and that was 13 years ago, and he still lives with me, so.but i can comment on his other abby-inspired tattoo, which is another deal-breaker for me. the one that says, in hebrew: I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine. leaving aside the fact that he is not jewish, and there is still some jewish cultural discomfort regarding tattoos, it is just another personal bugbear: people who get tattoos in languages not their own and with which they have no personal connection.which view i expressed aloud one time to an ex , forgetting that he had this tattoo: which is the japanese kanji symbol for \"musician\" (or it might just be \"music\" but this is the one i remember him having, so he probably just fucked up, which is why we don\\'t get tattoos of these things in the first place, hmmm??? and - clearly it wasn\\'t a deal-breaker in this case. whatever) which resulted in wounded eyes and me having to do some quick verbal jazz-hands, because i am terribly indelicate and bad at relationships. but still - i think it is dumb. co-opting a culture to be \"cool\" is just the opposite.but enough about \"why i wouldn\\'t date travis\" which is neither here nor there. this book is just bananas, in so many ways. characters are oblivious about their own feelings and the feelings of others. america is inconsistent with her wanting abby to be with travis and her warning her away from him. the poker/mafia subplot is laughable whose only narrative excuse is that it supposedly broadens abby\\'s character and attempts to plant the seed that she isn\\'t as clueless as she appears, and has been using secret ninja poker face this whole time and maybe the prey was the predator all along, and after the reveal, she is suddenly a different person, and travis is in awe of her and suddenly the power is in her hands. but it doesn\\'t wash. it could, but in the hands of a stronger author, one who isn\\'t so prone to inconsistencies. like that one with america. and this one:page 91 - Parker nodded toward the living room and smiled. \"You wanna dance?\"page 134 - abby asks parker to danceHe shook his head. \"Uh… i don\\'t dance.\"but… you just...here are moments of what should be clarity:I closed my eyes. \"We are dysfunctional, Travis. I think you\\'re just obsessed with the thought of owning me more than anything else.\"\"That\\'s not true. I love you more than my life, Pigeon,\" he said, hurt.\"That\\'s exactly what I mean. That\\'s crazy talk.\"\"It\\'s not crazy. It\\'s the truth.\"but then the inevitable backpedal:\"Do you know what co-dependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.“It\\'s dangerous to need someone that much. You\\'re trying to save him and he\\'s hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\" I smiled at the ceiling. \"It doesn\\'t matter what or why it is. When it\\'s good, Kara... it\\'s beautiful.”little moron.and the \"it\\'s okay for me, but not for other people\" attitude.\"Can you believe how ridiculous they are? The girls here are shameless,\" America said.Finch shook his head in awe. \"It\\'s Travis. I think it\\'s the bad-boy thing. They either want to save him or they think they\\'re immune to his wicked ways. I\\'m not sure which.\"\"It\\'s probably both,\" I laughed, giggling at the girls waiting for Travis to pay them attention. \"Can you imagine hoping you\\'re the one he\\'ll pick? Knowing you\\'ll be used for sex?\"\"Daddy issues,\" America said, taking a sip of her drink.but, wait. aren\\'t you….but then, if anyone has daddy issues, it is abby. bizarre, seemingly transplanted from a book with a different plot altogether, daddy issues. now, abby\\'s poor view of all the women travis slept with but then sleeping with him anyway because he has changed and he really loves her etc etc has been called out by a lot of reviewers, and that whole slut-shaming accusation has been made.and i can understand that interpretation of it, but it\\'s not necessarily the same thing as being disgusted with women who are undignified in their pursuit of men. i\\'d be a hypocrite if i judged women who had experienced a rich full sexual life, but there\\'s a difference between the confident woman who chooses her lovers selectively, and the women who stand in line outside a hair-metal tour bus to be systematically and clinically fucked by the bassist. there is an uneven power-dynamic between women who want to fuck fame (even such small-scale fame as travis represents) just for the sake of fame and a story to tell, and that dynamic is different from those girls who are just party girls who like what they like. to me, the: two voluptuous bottle-blondes wearing Sigma Kappa tees where One of them sat on Travis\\' lap, the other sat beside him, pawing at his shirt. are kind of ick, and i don\\'t think it is anti-feminist to think they are ick. because they aren\\'t being portrayed as female characters, they are being used by the author as evidence of travis\\' sexual allure. but again, i have that need for dignity, so - yeah - i judge. but i also judge the judge abby. i judge everyone in this book - they are all horrible people.like in this scene between abby and travis\\' father.which will have to be continued in the comments because, as predicted, i have gone on too long.come to my blog!

BUT NO, HE WANTS TO FUCK HER TOO because like how can he not want too??? you\\'re really fake if you think otherwise. abby is such a hot girl!also,,, screaming/arguing and fighting constantly over the smallest things is just SUCH a healthy relationship to have with your friend. treating them like they\\'re lesser than you is being SUCH A GREAT FRIEND!!!! because that\\'s how she acts with Travis,, like fighting and arguing over the dumbest of shit and i wanted to slam my head against the wall and question who even considered getting this shit published.\"also, if you want to have sex and flirt then you\\'re also a dirty whore and a slut and youre dumb and youre so gross, why do you exist, bye!!!!\" this is pretty much how everyone in this book think about women who want to have sex. if i could count the number of times, abigail or someone else called the many girls in this book a whore/slut for flirting with travis and having sex, i\\'d be a fucking millionaire right now and buying better books than this one. like honestly, i was so disgusted at how badly the women are slut shamed jfc. like, thinking about this book makes me want to throw up and cry about why i even breathe oxygen anymore.if you think Abby is horrible, don\\'t you worry, THERE\\'S SOMEONE WORSE. aka Travis McBitch, the fucking douchiest dickbag of them all. this guy is not hot.he\\'s not. pleasehe\\'s not hot. this guy is a fucking MistakeTM. he\\'s disgusting and equally as annoying as abby. i don\\'t know what the FUCK he saw in Abby McFuckingBitch that was worth getting yelled at and treated like a dogshit. anyways, he\\'s just as worse. first of the firsts, he is scary. he\\'s scary. he\\'s scary. he\\'s fucking scary, extremely controlling and just no. there was this one time where he told abigail to change out of her clothes because they were \"revealing\" hmmmmm how about no, you sausage roll of dicks. women can wear whatever the fuck they want?? fuck off,,, thanks. also, he\\'s really violent??? there was this one scene where he trashed the entire room and broke everything and no one could control him. yikes. he also got borderline psychopathic-ly angry when she was flirting with some guy and decided to date a sweet, nice boy who is not Travis!!! in a scary drunken haze, he opened the car door, in which abby was making out with her bf and pulled her out because he couldn\\'t stand them. he also doesn\\'t let her fucking hang out with any guy and wants to control every aspect of her love life (or just her life in general) aka don\\'t love anyone but me.

On one hand, I get it why authors might prefer to go down the self-publishing road. With an industry that gives us Halo and Hades, I\\'d be disheartened too. The thing is, indie writers face a lot of difficulties getting their stuff out there and making a profit, because the general assumption is that self-pubbed books are poorly written, poorly edited things that no agent wanted to take on. So I was very conflicted about reviewing this book. EDIT But not anymore. There\\'s a difference between engaging in discussion and blocking your ears to criticism entirely. I will not, in any way, support an author who allows their fans to attack anyone who disagrees, and then blocks the voices of those who object. Now that I have this out of the way, let\\'s look at \"Beautiful Disaster\". The plot:(view spoiler)[ Abby: I\\'m attracted to a guy who smokes and fights and is basically horrible for me.Travis: I\\'m going to wear you down with my wit and charm and sob story.Abby: Okay, so I like him and he helps me pass my classes, so Ima gonna be FRIENDS with him and totally not take issue with the fact that he had a threesome while I was in the other room. Travis: I\\'m not good enough for her, I\\'m not good enough for her, so I\\'ll let her go on this date with another guy, but then I\\'ll get shitfaced and make a scene. If that doesn\\'t tell her how much I love her, I dunno what will.Drama. Sex. Drama. Drama. Drama. More sex. Abby: So I\\'ll give you a chance, but you gotta change. I don\\'t need more booze and hissy fits from the men in my life.Travis: Fine with me, but you can\\'t leave the house without a coat on because I\\'ll beat the shit out of anyone who looks at you.Abby: You know, I get the feeling that perhaps, maybe this might not have been such a good idea.Drama. Drama. Sex. Drama. Abby\\'s daddy comes along.Daddy: I owe money to a mafioso. Help me out.Abby: Just change my nickname from Pigeon to Doormat. Travis: Hey, this bad guy is offering me a lot of money to fight. So instead of working my ass off towards a relationship, I\\'ll just buy Abby\\'s love. Failproof! Drama. Drama. Drama. Draaaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaaaa. They break up, but now they\\'re at his dad\\'s house and having sex, then she dates this guy again, but then Travis drags her to a fight to stake his claim on her, drama, drama, drama, Abby moves on, Travis beats up someone else, sex, now they\\'re together again, I start skimming pages... Final fight, fire...Abby: You know, even though you tattoo-ed my name on your wrist and I totally freaked out, I think we should totally get married.Travis: Hello, American Airlines? I\\'m calling my girlfriend\\'s bluff, gimme two tickets to Vegas.Abby: I\\'m going to get a \"Mrs. Maddox\" tattoo, because this totally symbolizes my independence and emancipation from my torrid past.The End (hide spoiler)]I think the little tongue-in-cheek take sums it up pretty well, don\\'t you? No? Oh, come on!Look, I have nothing against indie writers. I didn\\'t dislike this book because it was self-pubbed. Sure, there were typos here and there, but we all get those sometimes. Big deal. No, my problem with this book was the plot. Specifically, it was the whole \"bad-boy-that-turns-good\" character typecasting, the doormat heroine, the absolutely insipid ending...I just... I\\'m sorry, Goodreads, but no. Just no. I know nothing original exists in this world, but nothing stops authors from trying to break the mould. Travis is just so painfully archetypal that I feel he was created from a checklist - tattoos, motorbike, dangerous drinking habits, promiscuity, fighting - it\\'s all there, wrapped up in a nice package of douchery. I\\'m so tired of that same old character that I can\\'t even read the story as a \\'guilty pleasure\\'. Retire him or give him a makeover - times are a\\'changing.But wait, you say, surely there are some redeeming qualities about the book. After all, the reason why this archetype exists is because the story connected to it is good. Bad boy narratives are usually about a journey, and redemption through love, right?Yeah, no, this doesn\\'t happen.Oh, sure, Abby shows a remarkable spine for about half the book, but really, there are times when Travis\\' douchery just got to me. And, ultimately, neither of these characters changes - what we\\'re supposed to get from this book was that Abby, no matter how much she wanted to escape her father, really just wanted a younger version of him whom she could bang. Which is very Freudian of her, but not a very pleasant thing to read about. Yes, I know this is a fantasy. Yes, I know this isn\\'t real. But countless girls and women out there are stuck in relationships that are abusive. And to me, Travis\\' behaviour is full of red flags - obsessing over her whereabouts, driving dangerously, dragging her to risky places where he knows she is in danger, but takes her to nevertheless. He goes crazy is she decides to wear a skimpy dress to a dance, forces her to change if he doesn\\'t like how she\\'s dressed, drags her away from a date (with another guy) to take her to a fighting match... need I go on?I\\'m not suggesting that \"Beautiful Disaster\" is trying to teach us something. But I sure as hell don\\'t think a \"Mrs. Maddox\" tattoo is an appropriate ending to this. Sorry, folks.

Only a fool would underestimate the growing power and influence of the e-book market in relation to mainstream publishing and I’ve noticed several particular books coming up time and time again amongst both my GoodReads friends and the book blogging scene in general. This book is one of them. I’d be lying if I said that I ever thought this was my sort of book since I’ve made my disdain for the ‘bad boy’ romantic interest known clear many times. However, I do honestly try to go into every book with an open mind. This is the job of a reviewer and it’s what every book deserves, be it traditionally published or otherwise.I loathed this book.Before I even touch upon the abusive relationship in this book (yes, I consider it an abusive one and will detail why later on), I shall discuss other elements of why I so seriously disliked “Beautiful Disaster”. First, there were several spelling and grammar errors which wouldn’t be considered acceptable in traditional publishing so I shall not consider them acceptable here. Why shouldn’t I hold self-published novels to the same standard as traditionally published ones? The writing style itself was fine, although I did wonder if the book started out as fan-fiction or if McGuire got her start in fan-fiction writing. This book reads like it was written chapter-by-chapter in the manner of fan-fiction, with the expected pacing issues that usually accompany this. This also applies to the plotting, which felt predictable, plodding and offered nothing new to the bad boy trope, nor the college romance trope. Character-wise, before I even discuss the breeding pair, I had serious issues. Travis has no respect for women, and almost every other woman in this book, no matter how fleeting their appearance, is described by the narrator Abby in the most derisive terms. Almost every woman Travis encounters wants to have sex with him and acts as seductively as possible when around him, which leads to many of them being called a “slut”, an “STD ridden imbecile”, a “whore”, and so on. They’re also frequently referred to as “bimbos” by Abby, which sets up a sort of virgin/whore complex with Abby and Travis’s former sexual partners. Travis’s promiscuity is mentioned many times but never as derisively as it is when in relation to the women he consensually has sex with. The women in this book seem to exist solely to inflate Travis’s ego and reassert the insulting double standard of “he’s a stud, she’s a slut” (Travis declares that he is a man of standards in that he never sleeps with ugly women. Tell me that’s an attractive trait). The one female character given a modicum of personality and common sense is Kara, Abby’s roommate. She’s the token ‘bitch’ which means she is supposed to be deserving of our scorn or ridicule but she’s the only character to stand up to Abby and tell her Travis is co-dependent and could be dangerous. Abby’s so-called best friends America and Shepley don’t seem particularly concerned with how at risk Abby often is. Granted, there are some scenes where America stands up for her friend, but more often than not she is more likely found to be pushing Abby towards getting together with a noted violent jerk. In fact, America often seems to hold Abby responsible for Travis’s actions. She’s an erratically written character – first telling Abby to stay away from Travis, then pushing her towards him. She ends up serving more as a conflict creating mouthpiece than a real character.Then we come to Travis.If you were ever to create a bad boy checklist, Travis would tick off every box on that list; Troubled upbringing, parent issues, tattoos, extremely sexy, smarmy attitude that others somehow see as charming, motorbike, heavy drinking, no respect for authority, promiscuity, etc. We are supposed to believe that Travis is something of an irresistible enigma. Men secretly admire him, women want to sleep with him, he’s even so charming that he can lead a cafeteria sing-along like a bad boy Zac Efron. He gets straight A’s without having to work for them. He keeps a top class athlete physique and unbeatable fighting skills without having to work out or train in any way. He’s an unoriginal character who only differs from every other bad boy in literature right now by going the full distance in his extreme behaviour. Travis is a disturbed individual in every way. He can’t control his temper, he gets jealous at the slightest of actions, he is prone to smashing up whatever is in sight, and he emotionally manipulates Abby into doing his will, including telling her what to wear, where to go and accompany him to events where she’ll have to act romantically with him. The list goes on. He gives her the nickname “Pigeon” for some ridiculous, badly explained reason, and refers to her as this for the majority of the book instead of by her name. Sometimes these actions are rightfully criticised and Abby shows a remarkable amount of backbone at times in her criticism of Travis, but time and time again she forgives him and time and time again he commits further controlling, manipulative and violent acts. At one point, he punches a man for touching her arm, coming precariously close to punching Abby. Below is a passage from the book, after Abby has had sex with Travis and left without saying goodbye:“Travis is a fucking wreck! He won’t talk to us, he’s trashed the apartment, threw the stereo across the room… Shep can’t talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It’s scaring me! Abby, he’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was… Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door… broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!” This is not okay. This is not normal. It’s certainly not ‘passionate’ or ‘sexy’. I understand that this is supposed to be somewhat messed up. However, there is a complete lack of authorial control over the contents of this book. The choice of a 1st person narrative is part of the problem. Abby, nor any other character in the book, fully explains their motives and she can barely explain why she feels so strongly about Travis, let alone describe why she continues to come back to Travis again and again. Even when she condemns his abhorrent actions, it’s never fully convincing. She stands by and watches him pummel people to the ground on more than one occasion and seemingly accepts it. In fact, the entire book seems to accept his actions as just being part of wacky crazy Travis’s wild life. He’s the stud (never a slut) with a temper and it’s your own fault for pissing him off. I don’t care what people are saying about you, you don’t bash a man’s head in with a lunch tray! Despite doing this – in public! – over and over again, nobody in the college intervenes, the police are never called on him and the possibility of mental health problems, which would be perfectly justified, are never brought up. The author has mentioned how realistic this book is but this particular element is definitely not. No college in America would accept this behaviour, no matter how many A’s that student gets. This book is supposed to be in the vein of the old favourite ‘bad boy and the one girl who changes him’ trope. But that’s the biggest issue here. He doesn’t change. They marry, she gets a “Mrs Maddox” tattoo and this is all seen as okay, but it’s not. Throughout the book he talks about how Abby has changed him or how he needs her with him at all times to help him become a better person, but he remains a violent, rude and ultimately dangerous individual throughout. On top of having absolutely no respect for the many women he has slept with, he never really has any respect for Abby. He makes major decisions that would affect them both without listening to Abby, he stalks her several times and never seems to truly trust her. If he truly trusted her, why would he become so violent when she’s in the presence of other men? Listening to Travis and Abby justify his actions sounded far too much like the justifications of spousal abuse, the broken down words of a beaten wife trying to prove that he’s really a wonderful man who loves her deeply but sometimes he just can’t help himself. By the end of the book, Travis and Abby declare that they are each-others for life but Travis is clearly the one with the power here. Does anyone think he’ll ever really change? Someone I love very dearly is in a situation like this, albeit an emotional one rather than violent one. The difference? He’s a regular looking man, not a tattooed motor-biking bad boy. Not so sexy now, is it? This book may be right up your alley. You may be a fan of the bad boy trope and here it is taken to the most extreme conclusion without resorting to wife battering, although in my opinion a lot of Travis’s behaviour is that of an abusive spouse. If this book is your thing then more power to you. I may not understand why but for some people, the idea of a damaged man being consumed by his obsession for a woman is an ideal fantasy, and I have no right to criticise that fantasy, no matter how unhealthy it may be. This book’s got a lot of fans. I’m not one of them. I despised this book. “Beautiful Disaster” now topples “Hush Hush” and becomes the most disgusting book I have ever read. 0/5 (that one star is too good for this).

Thanks to my mother who recommended me this book, otherwise I never would've picked this book up. I went into this book blind because I heard a lot of mixed reviews about it so I didn't know what to really expect when I read this book. I really really liked it. That's pretty much all I can say. There was nothing I didn't like about it. I like a hero that's possessive and gets jealous because ultimately it means that the hero does actually care about the heroine. I also think Travis is a good example of the perfect bad boy. He fights, he's popular, has tattoos, drives a motorcycle and sleeps around etc. Travis sleeping with other women didn't bother me at all, I know it probably should bother me, but that just makes me more anxious to see how he wins the girl in the end. Abby was a really good heroine, she was very likable and probably one of the few heroine's I actually enjoyed reading the perspective from.

H. O. A!!I am trying my darnedest to come up with a word that would best describe what I just read, because honestly, this book has left me a bit speechless.I’m guessing an apt word would be “intense.” Intense emotions, intense love, intense actions. An intense, toxic relationship! Despite of all his flaws, which he revealed unashamedly, I fell head over heels for the hero, Travis, but the heroine, Abby, well ... she needed someone to knock some pure ever lovin’ sense into her. I mean seriously!!Although this is a romance, it sometimes read like a suspense, as each time I turned a page I kept one eye shut wondering what kind of trouble Travis was going to get himself into next.This was one of the most compelling ‘bad boy falls for the good girl,’ on again/off again romances I have ever read. Just as the title implies their relationship is a beautiful disaster. I pounded the mattress with my fists. “You can’t tell me what to do anymore, Travis. I don’t belong to you.” In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. ”WELL, I BELONG TO YOU!” The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch. He looked at my lips, panting, “I belong to you,” he whispered, his anger melting as he realized how close we were. They were so right for each other it was ’beautiful,’ yet so wrong for each other it was a ’disaster.’ Of course, once again, I am deliberately being vague, because the less you know about the storyline, the more you will enjoy it. I will tell you it is a YA/NA read.So buckle up, and enjoy the ride. It is going to be wild, bumpy, and don’t forget, intense!

      "[('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Sophia.', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6520961-sophia', 'Nov 02, 2011', '', '5590', ' * Warning: If you\\'re easily offended by cursing, and/or aggressivity, then don\\'t FUCKING read this. *I am literally losing it. This book contains one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever read in any book. EVER.So here\\'s one excerpt from the book. Abby slept with Travis and left his apartment in the morning without saying goodbye. This is his reaction, a few hours later : “Travis is a fucking wreck! He won’t talk to us, he’s trashed theapartment, threw the stereo across the room… Shep [roommate] can’t talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It’s scaring me! Abby, he’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was… Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door… broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!”THIS. IS. NOT. OKAY.It\\'s not okay it\\'s not okay it\\'s not okay it\\'s NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. A few lines later, Abby calls him and everything\\'s back to normal. NO. I\\'M SORRY BUT NO. YOU NEED TO STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM HIM!Stalker :A person obsessed with another to the point of insanity, I.E. following one everywhere, calling constantly, showing signs of irrational, sick and unhealthy behavior, that can sometimes lead to extreme violence. It drives me insane to see how stalkerish behavior is considered as \"hot\". This book is really, really disturbing, and I don\\'t understand how it could get published. I got \\'til chapter 9 and basically I can\\'t take it anymore. The guy, Travis, suffers from very, very, VERY serious problems that should lead him straight into a shrink\\'s office (if not prison). I\\'m serious. Hey you girls, out there, who gave that book 5 stars, saying you want a Travis in your lives, in WHAT language do we have to tell you : it\\'s NOT normal behavior! And thank God that you haven\\'t met a guy like him because then that would be fucking dramatic! Don\\'t you understand how pathetic it is - all this characterization into unrealistic, hyper-sexualized, robotic male figures? These stories are all the fucking same! The guy is drop dead gorgeous, he\\'s dangerous, he\\'s sexy, he wants you even if you\\'re plain like hell and what he feels for you goes beyond words: Edward Cullen, Christian Grey, Patch Cipriano, Kellan Kyle, Travis Maddox, Damen Auguste or Dimitri Belikov, they\\'re all the same! Girls, NO ONE is going to want to watch you sleep, or forbid you to go visit your friends, or try to kill you because they love you so fucking much, because that\\'s not what NORMAL people do!! If you ever have the misfortune to get involved with someone like that, GO FILE A FUCKING RESTRAINING ORDER already! I find it appalling that young girls actually read this thinking this is exactly how they want to be treated like someday! We\\'re not pets! No fucking one in the world should be allowed to force you into behaving like a child! And I\\'m also thinking about boys, they\\'re not exactly the target audience but still; reading this must lead to wonder if this kind of behavior is what chicks like. It just spreads some sort of sickening message, \"be aggressive, show your jealousy as well as the fact that she\\'s yours, have no limits & be in control, use your strength to make a point, don\\'t let her do what she wants because she doesn\\'t really know what\\'s good for her. You know better\". It\\'s so hard to be a teenager, to try to find who you truly are, fiction that is destined to be read by young people has some kind of role, it should set examples instead of showing dysfunctional and extreme codependent relationships like they\\'re normal, because they\\'re not.Hey! YOUNG. ADULTS. That means you\\'re becoming a damn citizen, that you\\'ll study, get to vote, graduate, get a job and make a living! How could you ever want someone to be that intrusive? To go as far as breaking your car down so you can\\'t visit a friend?! (yes, Edward fucking Cullen I\\'m talking about you because YOU STARTED ALL THIS!)Don\\'t you realize it\\'s an offense to your FREEDOM when a guy\\'s literally forbidding you to get out of his house - even after you\\'ve asked him to let you go? When he\\'s dragging you out of the car because you\\'re making out with someone - all this when you\\'re not even involved with him? When he\\'s making you feel like shit because you\\'re seeing someone else? In fact, I won\\'t even get started on all the stupid reactions of Abby. What kind of girl dates a sweet guy and then goes sleeping in another man\\'s bed every night, when she HAS a choice ? She\\'s just a (stupid, lying and masochist) tease.Then she encourages Travis to beat the shit out of someone in the middle of the cafeteria? Seriously? Just because someone whistles at her or something, she says like \"Teach him some manners!\", and Travis throws himself on the man. Jesus, HONESTLY are you a beast or something? The poor guy ends up curled up in fetal position, covered in blood and unable to move. WTF? How can you stand this? No really, how can you read this? How can you accept it? Where is your sense of civility, or your instinct of protection towards the human kind? How come no one in the cafeteria stands up and tries to stop this? Easy answer. Because everyone is fucking terrified to get hurt! Like that\\'s normal!It scares the shit out of me to see that some people are able to read such violence and yet remain flippant and oh-so-casual like it\\'s no big deal. It makes me wonder, if they ever witness a real beat-up, would they react? Would they care? Or has modern entertainment succeeded in making all forms of abuse look so cavalier that it doesn\\'t shock anyone anymore?..Travis kept opening the door when Abby was with her date on the porch late at night, or coming in the bathroom when she was taking a shower, refusing to get out, and generally being so nosy it was a shocking wonder how NO ONE told him to fuck off! And that bitch didn\\'t even say ANYTHING! It\\'s so genuinely dangerous when a guy\\'s emotionally abusing/blackmailing you, or yelling at you for not obeying him, or trying to manipulate you! It is BUT romantic ! I don\\'t give a damn whether the guy\\'s a vampire, or an angel, or a fucking rock star, or if it was a bet or not, it\\'s just NOT okay!How could violence keep being depicted as something acceptable - let alone romantic? They\\'re at a party and he hits a boy who TOUCHES her ARM. Honestly! It\\'s not a game! And she keeps forgiving him, every single time.How do you think real abusive relationships start? What do you think are the profiles of the men who end up beating up their wives and/or showing extreme paranoiac behavior? (\"Did you just look at that guy? Did you fuck him? Are you cheating on me? Don\\'t you lie to me, bitch. I can see it in your eyes!\" This is how it ends, people.) You just wait a couple of years, Abby. Just wait until he loses it, AGAIN, and ends up taking a fucking swing at you.Again, awfully stupid and arrogant Abby stays at Travis\\'s apartment and she sleeps in his bed because she doesn\\'t really have a choice. Fine. But the guy\\'s bringing chicks in the living room, having a big loud threesome.. And one day later, he takes Abby\\'s hand, acts all warm and fuzzy, saying stuff like \"You\\'re better than this [I\\'m not fucking you like I fuck the rest of \\'em], that\\'s why I treat you different, don\\'t you ever get near boys or I swear I\\'ll destroy them.\" He even says \"I\\'ll end up in prison if I hear you slept with someone else\". When you read something like that your fucking alarm must spark off! I don\\'t know what to say anymore because honestly I feel like I shouldn\\'t even have to say all this in the first place. This should be like, SURVIVAL INSTINCT. What is this message that\\'s conveyed? Should we girls be standing on the corner, watching our love interest that pretendedly loves us fuck his brains out with the whole planet and calmly stating \"I can deal with his behavior because, well, he\\'s really hot\"? Or because he\\'s so romantic that he managed to nickname her after the most stupid volatile on earth, a.k.a Pidgeon?NO. FUCK NO. Why would you want to lock yourself up in some scary relationship where in the end, you just lose everything; your independence, as well as your right to have a life that doesn\\'t exclusively revolves around him? Why would you want to give up your liberty as an individual in order to be so tied up with your love interest that you can\\'t even breathe on your own? (And for those who pretendedly realized that it wasn\\'t healthy, but yet managed to like the book anyway: why would you want to witness such a relationship? What\\'s the pleasure in contemplating two people who never, ever realize how deep they\\'ve fallen into violence and abuse?) EDIT : I don\\'t care whether Travis (supposedly) changes at the end of the book. I don\\'t care for his pseudo redemption and/or efforts. What matters are the facts, here and now, that Abby acknowledges them while they\\'re horrible and still manages to stay with Travis. I couldn\\'t finish the fucking book because I was feeling sick to my stomach - and I insist on saying the characterization of the love story was goddamn awful and should never be seen as something okay. So do you honestly think I care when you say I should have finished it before writing all this? Give me a fucking break. I have witnessed abusive relationships in real life; this book depicts the beginning of one, and the memories alone are enough to make me wanna puke. I sure as hell won\\'t force myself to undergo the whole 400 pages. Besides, I read on some reviews that (spoilers):* At some point he won\\'t let her get out of the apartment because he thinks her clothes aren\\'t appropriate enough. Therefore he forces her to change. Okay. May I send you back to the \"This is not okay behavior\" part of the review? * They get married at Las Vegas (at 19).* That after him getting an \"Abby\" tattoo, she gets one too that reads \"Mrs Maddox\". I\\'d like to talk about this for a second. I\\'m a firm believer that you can love someone in an unconditional way without having to show it with material proofs. Marriage and tattoos? What is this? Travis unexpectedly got an \"Abby\" tattoo, without warning her, without considering the consequences of such an act (but I guess I\\'m asking too much from him, considering he\\'s got tribal tattoos all over his body). Anyway, Travis emotionally challenged her, and so she got one too. Again, what is this? A leash that she will never, ever be able to free herself from? What if their relationship doesn\\'t last? What if they get a divorce? Basically, until the day she dies, she will look at her skin and remember that at some point in her life, she chose to mark herself not as a person, but as a wife. As someone\\'s something. And that\\'s just terrible. So. *Breathe*. In my humble opinion, I think it is better that I just don\\'t finish it. Like, ever.I\\'m writing all this because I feel so MAD about this book. Women fought and still fight every day so we can be treated as equals and not as objects. I\\'m not going to sit still and pretend this book didn\\'t horrify me. Because it did. It fucking did, big time.Also believe it or not but I\\'m not doing this to tear the author down, I don\\'t really care about her, my review isn\\'t about her but about the book. It\\'s nothing personal, I respect her as a human being. I just feel very sorry for the messages she conveys through this everything but Beautiful Disaster. *** EDIT#2: : Yeah, so. About that. There seems to be some kind of Reviewers VS Authors movement here on Goodreads (but also on Amazon, Twitter, etc.). Since the author of Beautiful Disaster made me be a part of it, I\\'ve decided to join here two links. The first one is a blog post, written by author Hannah Moskowvitz. Check it out, it\\'s really good. Second one, written by Nafiza, on her blog. And I have one thing to say: you go, girl. *** EDIT#3: : One more, because McGuire just doesn\\'t know how to let it go. *** EDIT#4: : Yes, I know this is way too long already but I wanted to add something. For the trolls who\\'ve been telling me for the past fucking year that this is just fiction: not only do you come off as stupidly paradoxical for being on Goodreads in the first place, because it\\'s a website for people who feel passionate about books, but you\\'re also wrong. When you read a book for entertainment purposes only, you\\'re relaxed and receptive, almost vulnerable, as unconsciously, you assume that what you\\'re reading is okay and right (otherwise it wouldn\\'t be published, would it?) Therefore you don\\'t really pay attention to the real meaning behind what you\\'re reading. After all, \"It\\'s just a book\", right? Wrong. Sometimes you have to wake up, and realize that what you\\'re reading is in reality a dangerous stinking piece of shit. Yes, it\\'s a book, but young girls read this and unconsciously absorb the messages that are being sent, and then it has an impact on the way they carry out their personal lives, without even realizing that stupid books like this one contributed to giving her a black eye and pushing her down the stairs. Because they\\'ve been reading about that \"hot\" behavior for so long, they\\'ve been sexualizing it and they\\'ve been associating it with good looks, and of course, with the ultimate perfect happy ending. In reality, it doesn\\'t work like that. You can\\'t change someone who\\'s damaged and unstable just because you love them, no matter what the books try to tell you. Don\\'t waste your time trying. And the fact that Travis Maddox is described as being extremely hot is a manipulation that tries to trick you into thinking that if it\\'s beautiful, then it must be good. Think about that: a weird, ugly guy who follows you around and destroys his apartment because you didn\\'t pick up your phone wouldn\\'t be hot, it\\'d be creepy as fuck. And that\\'s what I\\'m asking you now: try to think beyond the \"good looks\" (and the sugarcoating that goes with it) that the medias are trying to feed you, and just think by yourself. By the way, it also leads to fucking idiotic bitches who tweet about how they wouldn\\'t mind being beaten up by Chris Brown because he\\'s so hot. What the fuck? There aren\\'t enough words to say how wrong this is. What do I care, you say? I care because I\\'m a woman and reading this makes me ashamed.Wake the fuck up, girls, and never accept being treated like that. You are an individual, you are important and you matter. Your decisions will have impacts. You deserve so much better than someone like this Travis-fucking-asshole. Let him go die in a fucking hole and go lead your own life like the independent and free person you are. And please, destroy the person who will so much as try to tell you otherwise. Finally, last but not least. Due to some comments, it feels like it\\'s time to clarify some stuff. If this review pissed you off, or offended you, you should know that I don\\'t give a shit about, well, what you think. If this is about my swearing, or my aggressivity, you were warned from the very first line and I don\\'t have anything to say to you about it. You knew it was a 1 star rating so basically, no one forced you to read but yourself. Get over it and move on. Simple as.And I know I mentioned the 5 stars ratings girls and all, but really it was just semantics, don\\'t feel like you should comment my review to express your disagreement or your undying love for Travis, cause whatever you say, it won\\'t change the way I feel. I mean it, don\\'t comment. Because I don\\'t give a fuck about what you have to say! Unless it is interesting, of course. But if you’re here to defend the psychopath and try to explain how in the end the relationship comes full circle, or why his unacceptable behavior is only masculine and protective, please SAVE YOUR TIME. (And mine). Obviously, we won\\'t get along and if you can\\'t understand what I\\'m trying to say then it\\'s fine, keep loving Eclipse and Blood Promise and Hush Hush, I mean, it\\'s cool. Honestly, I\\'m serious, tastes and perceptions and ideals are all different and I don\\'t have a say in this, and neither do you. So, well, you can just save your time with the comments. And fuck off already. Thank you.

This is where we meet Travis \\'Mad Dog\\' Maddox, the male romantic lead. He, of course, wins his fight. The female lead, Abby, is attending the fight club for the first time that night. She ends up with blood on her cashmere sweater and a new name given to her by Travis, who doesn\\'t even bother to ask for her name before arbitrarily deciding on \\'Pigeon.\\' It is the way one might rename a dog one has adopted.We meet Travis again in the cafeteria. He is being \"followed by two voluptuous bottle-blondes wearing Sigma Kappa tees. One of them sat on Travis\\' lap, the other sat beside him, pawing at his shirt.\" Abby\\'s best friend America, who also happens to be dating Travis\\'s cousin and roommate, makes a snide comment. One of the blonde\\'s calls her a skank. Travis \"lets his knees give way, sending her tumbling to the floor\" because America is his friend. This little interlude sets up two major reoccurring issues: girl on girl hate and Travis treating girls like garbage to step over. Every girl in the book except for Abby and America is a skank, a bitch or a bitchy skank. As for Travis, this incident of deliberately humiliating a girl in public and dropping her on the floor like the used condom wrapper she represents to him is actually as close to a gentleman as he ever gets because this is one of the mildest examples of his behavior.After lunch, Travis and Abby conveniently have a class together although they seemed to have seen each other for the first time at the fight last night. Whatever, get used to this author making up shit as she goes along and writing inconsistently from start to finish. I can give you a list of minor (yet annoying) continuity issues in the comment section below if asked.Travis fixates on Abby and sits beside her, leaving disappointed girls by his usual seat. He indicates she should take notes for him and spends the rest of the class zoned out. Never fear though! Travis is a freaking genius. He doesn\\'t need notes or studying or attending classes to ace the grades. On a similar note, he also does not need to eat healthy or exercise to maintain his muscle mass and six pack! I\\'m sorry, but every guy I\\'ve talked to with a body like Travis\\'s could go on extensively about his diet and workout regime. We don\\'t have to worry about believability in this world because despite the lack of traditional fantasy markings nothing about this book remotely resembles reality. In this world, control and abuse can turn into a happily ever after.With minimal effort Travis pesters Abby into agreeing to come to his apartment after school with her friend America, who is there often to see her own boyfriend, Shepley, Travis\\'s cousin. She agrees and then attempts to dress in the most disgusting way possible: \"My hair was piled on top of my head in a messy bun. I had scrubbed the makeup from my face and repalced my contacts with rectangular black-rimmed glasses. Sporting a ratty t-shirt and sweatpants, I shuffles along in a pair of flip flops.\" I\\'ll hold on while you get your favorite religious artifact to hold off this monster. This description pretty much matches me at the moment on my day off. Rawr.Anyway, Travis is not put off by this visual and decides to drag her out to dinner, which he *gasp* never does with the girls he sleeps with. Abby\\'s friend America is the least helpful person when it comes to rejecting Travis\\'s unwanted advances.\"I was just heading out for dinner. You hungry, Pidge?\" (We still have no idea why he\\'s calling her this.)\"I already ate,\" I shrugged. (Dialogue is routinely shrugged and smiled rather than spoken.)\"No you haven\\'t,\" America said before realizing her mistake. \"Oh...er...that\\'s right, I forgot you grabbed a... pizza? Before we left.\"I can\\'t even tell you how much trouble my friend would be in if she did that to me. Still crappy friend aside, no one forces Abby to go with Travis, no one forces her to get on the back of her motorcycle. She does all of these things despite being extremely uncomfortable around him because Abby is an idiot. During dinner Travis opens up to her about his dead mother and they connect a bit. So much so that he insists on sitting beside her the next day at lunch by bullying someone else out of an already occupied chair. And it is bullying. He does not ask for the chair so much as claims it already belongs to him (much like Abby) and then he stares the guy down until he moves. Abby is pleased with the attention and the girls looking at her to see who Travis insisted on sitting beside.The next big plot movement involves broken boilers in America and Abby\\'s dorm room. America\\'s solution is that they move in with Shep and Travis until they fix the boilers. What... the hell? I can\\'t comprehend how moving off campus to be near hot water could possibly be more convenient than living on campus and heading to an off campus apartment once a day for a shower. Really, you\\'re not supposed to be thinking this much, but since Abby protests vehemently before capitulating you do get a lot of time to think about what a stupid idea this is. I would have preferred a day of skipping a shower or a cold shower to living with someone who made me uncomfortable.Abby and America arrive at the apartment just as Travis\\'s latest fling(?) is getting ready to leave. She offers him her number and he declines in front of an audience of two other girls and his roommate, letting her know exactly what she means. They\\'re not a silent audience either: \"Every time!\" America said. She looked at the woman. \"How are you surprised by this? He\\'s Travis fucking Maddox! He\\'s famous for this very thing, and every time they\\'re surprised!\"America\\'s boyfriend must comfort her after she delivers this tirade even though the girl she insinuated was, at best, naive and, at worse, stupid is still standing there. Abby is not pleased with all of this because she didn\\'t realize \"Shepley\\'s apartment was a revolving door for clueless bimbos.\" I love how other girls in this book are treated. It\\'s just fantastic. My favorite is Abby calling the girls Travis sleeps with STD infested imbeciles.Abby \"stared at the couch, the cushions still askew and bunched up from its recent use. I recoiled at the thought of how many women had given themselves away against the fabric. Itchy fabric at that.\" Nice, right? Nothing about Travis or how he treated them, just the awful, dirty sexually active girls.Abby decides she can\\'t possibly sleep on the couch so Travis offers her his bed. He does not fuck girls in there. This speaks volumes about how he views women, good enough for his dick, not good enough for his sheets. I\\'ll kill the suspense here. He sleeps with her in his bed, but not before he keeps wandering in and out of the bathroom while she\\'s showering! He brings her a towel and her toothbrush while she\\'s showering and then ignores her shrieks at him to get out. He does not knock before entering the bathroom nor did he announce himself. He just opens the door and makes himself at home. It\\'s creepy. He brings her stuff in, which means he went through her bags. She shrieks about him going through her stuff and he ignores her, not offering an excuse or apology. She shrieks at him to get out again and he insists he has to brush her teeth all while she\\'s naked on the other side of the curtain. It\\'s all invasive, scary, and the start of a very alarming and controlling relationship.I wouldn\\'t have finished showering. I would have gotten dressed, soapy hair and all, before heading back to my home. Abby, who has stood in the shower with her arms wrapped defensively around her chest listening to him brush his teeth, gets out of the shower and SMILES at the night moisturizer Travis brought her while violating her privacy and personal space. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.During Abby and America\\'s long stay with Travis and Shepley (seriously, the campus couldn\\'t open another dorm building for them to shower in?), they all go to a bar together. In an attempt to prove they\\'re not sleeping together to the rest of the school Travis and Abby dance together? I don\\'t get the logic there. Anyway he licks her throat. She is not happy. He\\'s mad she\\'s not happy and grinds up on some other girl. She flirts with the bartender, but Travis puts a swift stop to that! Because the guy is a rapist! He\\'s been arrested for it and Travis knows all about it! Thank God for Travis. Thank God for his instructions not to take drinks from anyone but him and his cousin, because they treat girls with all the respect in the world and are the most upstanding citizens to take drinks from. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.They are still a foursome when Travis gets called for another fight. He asks Abby to go with him. America gives her non-Abbyish clothes to wear (a deep cut, yellow halter top and tight, low-rise jeans). Travis takes one look at her and DEMANDS she change. Travis\\'s mouth fell open. \"Oh, hell no. Are you trying to get me killed? You\\'ve gotta change, Pidge.\"\"What?\" I asked, looking down.America grabbed her hips. \"She looks cute, Trav, leave her alone!\"Travis took my hands and led me down the hall. \"Get a t-shirt on... and some sneakers. Something comfortable.\"\"What? Why?\"\"Because I\\'ll be more worried about who\\'s looking at your tits in that shirt instead of Hoffman,\" he said, stopping at his door.\"I thought you said you didn\\'t give a damn what anyone else thought?\"\"That\\'s a different scenario, Pigeon.\" Travis looked down at my chest and then up at me. \"You can\\'t wear this to a fight, so please... just... please just change,\" he stuttered, shoving me into the room and shutting me in. Abby gets changed.Then she gets on his stupid motorcycle again while he drives dangerously. When they get there, Travis claims he can go his entire fight without getting hit. Abby calls bullshit. Travis offers to make a bet. He won\\'t sleep with anyone for a month if he gets hit. If he doesn\\'t get hit she has to continue living with him in his apartment for a month. I don\\'t even have words to express how I felt when this stupid girl took this stupid bet, but she does. Travis wins. She must live with him. I think when you take away someone\\'s constant choice to be with you then it becomes skeevy.Shepley gets angry at Abby for the agreement because she promised not to get involved with Travis. Whenever Travis screws around with the best friend of the girl he\\'s dating it ends badly for him. Of course, he doesn\\'t fight with Travis or demand promises of Travis, no he screams at the girl. Abby insists there\\'s nothing sexual between them and that there never will be. Travis comes out of the shower during all her insisting and gets annoyed. As revenge he goes to a bar, comes home at two AM with not one but two girls. He goes into the room where Abby is sleeping, fishes through his bedside table for some condoms and heads back out into the living room to have a threesome. She sits there listening to him giggling and moaning etc because she can\\'t leave the bedroom without walking through the living room where his little threesome is going on. When he\\'s finished, he kicks the girls out, and he gets back in bed with her reeking of whiskey.She gets out of bed, steps over condom wrappers and sleeps on the reclining chair. In the morning, America acts like a real friend for the first time and packs Abby\\'s things to take her home. Even Shepley is contrite. Travis wanders in during this conversation, having already been out to buy all of Abby\\'s favorite foods for the month she will be staying with him. I\\'m going to pause and say gifts after emotional or physical abuse are part of a pretty common cycle. Abby stays because Abby is an idiot who insists a bet is a bet. Travis apologizes and hedges around letting her out of the bet. When Abby indicates it is the only thing keeping her there he holds her to it.While she\\'s living with Travis, Abby starts a tentative relationship with a boy named Parker who seems pretty decent. Travis responds as one might expect even though he has made no real romantic gesture towards Abby when she leaves a party with Parker.He leaned in, seeming flustered. \"I\\'ll kill him if he touches you.\"\"I like him,\" I said, emphasizing each word.He seemed stunned at my confession and then his features turned severe. \"Fine. If he ends up holding you down in the backseat of a car, don\\'t come crying to me.\"Convenient how every guy except Travis is a rapist. Of course, Parker is not really a rapist. Travis is just insinuating it to scare Abby into going home with him. Because Travis is the safe choice. Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.Parker behaves like a gentleman, kissing her cheek goodnight. Travis is waiting so close to the door that he opens it before she can push which causes her to fall in. He does this just about every time she goes on a date with Parker. The only exception, I believe, was when he drunkenly went down to the car where they were kissing and pulled her out of it. The wheels of Parker\\'s shiny Porsche squealed out of the parking lot, and Travis lit a cigarette. \"You can go inside now, Mare.\"She tugged on my skirt. \"C\\'mon, Abby.\"\"Why don\\'t you stay, Abs,\" he seethed.I nodded for America to go ahead and she reluctantly complied. I crossed my arms, ready for a fight, preparing myself to lash out at him after the inevitable lecture. Travis took several drags from his cigarette, and when it was obvious that he wasn\\'t going to explain my patience ran out.\"Why did you do that?\" I asked.\"Why? Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!\" he yelled. His eyes were unfocused, and I could see he was incapable of rational conversation.I kept my voice calm. \"I may be staying with you, but what I do, and who I do it with is my business.\" (good for you, Abby!)He flicked his cigarette to the ground. \"You\\'re so much better than that, Pidge. Don\\'t let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.\"\"I wasn\\'t going to have sex with him!\" (so much for it being her business.)More vomit inducing craziness in which Abby accuses him of spying on her. He tells her he doesn\\'t want to know about when she sleeps with Parker. She says that would be a big step for her. He says that\\'s what all girls say. Abby says, \"I don\\'t mean the sluts you deal with! I mean me! I haven\\'t... ugh! Nevermind.\"Yes, she\\'s a virgin so she really is different from all the sluts he slept with! Ugh is right. I think waiting for someone you\\'re really comfortable with and really in love with is a good thing, but I also never felt superior to girls who felt differently about it. The girl on girl hate in this book is ridiculous.After Travis humiliates Abby in front of her date, intimidates and threatens her date until he leaves, and laughs with delight and relief over her virginity he then attempts to drunkenly seduce her. Abby goes along with it. (This is where I felt a migraine coming on). The seduction stops because Travis doesn\\'t want it to be like that between them. Lovely that the drunk Neanderthal calls all the shots.I\\'m only at thirty percent of the book here and I only have 25% of the room left to review so I\\'m going to start doing some heavy condensing.Creepy Things Travis Does:1. He buys Abby a puppy for her birthday to keep at his apartment so that she will always have to come back.2. He beats his friends to a bloody pulp in the school cafeteria for making sexual innuendos about Abby. In reality he would\\'ve got tasered by security. After several incidents he would\\'ve been kicked out of the university, but don\\'t worry about reality in this book.3. He lets Parker and the rest of the school believe he\\'s sleeping with Abby to chase him away.4. He refuses to allow Abby out of the bet even though he is strangling her healthy relationship with Parker.5. Immediately after Abby and Travis sleep together he calls himself her last first kiss then he destroys the apartment and rages at Shepley and America for helping her leave when his words creeps her out.6. After only a few weeks, he tattoos \"Pigeon\" on his wrist and a long Hebrew scripture quote about belonging to your beloved and your beloved belonging to you. Never has the word \\'belonging\\' seemed so threatening.7. Screams at her for accepting a drink from another guy because it could have roofies in it and besides, she\\'s HIS GIRL, HE will buy her drinks. NO ONE ELSE.8. Punches a guy who is touching her while her face is inches away from the guy\\'s face.9. Stalks her after a break up. Lies to his family about them still being together. Manipulates her into pretending to still be a couple so she\\'ll cook dinner Thanksgiving dinner for his family. Kisses and has sex with her even though he\\'s promised he wouldn\\'t cross those lines again. (I\\'m not absolving Abby of her stupidity here either.)10. Stalks her some more. Drags guys away from dancing with her. Threatens their lives if they go near her. Tosses her over his shoulder and drags her out of a party. Demands a designated driver take them to his apartment, drags her kicking and screaming out of the driver\\'s car, tosses her in his apartment. Somehow they end up having sex. Don\\'t fucking ask me. It grossed me out -- I can\\'t stomach re-reading it.Awful Plot Devices:1. Zac Effron sing along. I read in another review that Travis had the charm to pull off a Zac Effron sing along. I thought this was meant to be an exaggerated comparison... it was not. He sings Rolling Stone\\'s (I Can\\'t Get No) Satisfaction in the school cafeteria with the football players as back up singers. This is really not a joke.2. A trip to Vegas where Travis fights to win money so Abby can pay the debt her big time gambling father has transfered to her. Oh, did I not mention she is the daughter of a famous poker player?3. Travis getting offered $100,000 per fight to continue fighting in Vegas. He decides to take the offer despite Abby\\'s protests and then is shocked and a rage maniac when she breaks up with him because of it, despite knowing she wanted nothing to do with that lifestyle4. A basement fire at fight club bought on by gas lanterns. Because people really use those anymore. Don\\'t worry! Everyone important lives. Because this is reality.5. Abby proposes, they go to Vegas again to get married, she gets a tattoo that reads Mrs. Maddox and mentally refers to it as a brand several times.Real Ways this Book Could Have Ended in Order to be Realistic and Send a Message:1. Travis kills Abby in a drunken fit of rage over something she\\'s wearing, saying, and/or doing. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail.2. Travis kills some guy for interacting with Abby in a way he deems inappropriate. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail and either A. Abby visits him twice a week for the rest of her life or B. The guy\\'s death serves as a wake up call for Abby and she spends the rest of her life far, far away.3. Travis kills Abby and some guy in a drunken rage because he preceived a threat. Travis spends the rest of his life in jail.I don\\'t believe Travis is smart enough to get away with any of the murders because he usually doesn\\'t see any reason to hide his awful behavior. He does everything in front of many, many witnesses every single time. -I purchased this book several months ago because I planned on reading a lot of self-published books in 2012 as a reading project. I purchased it before I read the author\\'s blog post berating negative reviewers. I would not have purchased the book had the post happened before the purchase.

It wasn\\'t me being stupid and not realizing how great a book was until the second reading, like it was the first time I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone and Milkweed. It really is just an awful book.Every single character in this book is an absolute idiot - with the exception of Kara, who is the only character without her head firmly shoved up her ass. Actually, she nailed Abby and Travis right on the head when she said, \"Do you know what co-dependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.\" The one damn character who wasn\\'t a total idiot - and every time she was mentioned in the book Abby made her sound like a complete bitch. Actually, I suppose Parker wasn\\'t half bad either, save for his strange (but healthy!) interest in Abby. Oh, and he liked to call her \"Abs.\" BIG FUCKING DEAL. Personally, I\\'d prefer \"Abs\" to \"Pigeon\". But besides Kara and Parker, everyone sucks.Travis is irresistible. To everyone. Absolutely everyone. Girls literally throw themselves at him in sickening, unrealistic ways, despite how motherfucking clear it is that he only wants sex. He is extremely smart and gets perfect grades but never studies at all. He doesn\\'t even bother to pay attention in his classes. Not only that, but Travis Maddox is the hottest boy on the planet. He has a perfect, mind-blowing body although he doesn\\'t work out. I\\'m sorry, but that is fucking impossible. Ask any guy with a six-pack and I\\'m sure he\\'ll tell you what hard work it is to look like that. It is also fucking impossible for a guy who never, ever works out to easily take out two members of the God damn Las Vegas mob. Travis often says stupid things that clearly indicate the relationship between himself and Abby will turn to an abusive one sooner or later - when he makes her change her clothes before they go out because he thinks what she\\'s wearing is too revealing, for instance. He is not only mentally destructive, but physically as well. He destroys his apartment when he wakes up and Abby has left him. He kicks the shit out of anyone who even looks at Abby. He breaks his fucking phone because if he doesn\\'t, he won\\'t be able to stop himself from calling Abby. THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT NORMAL.I think the most annoying thing here is that everyone acts like Travis\\' behavior is okay. It\\'s not, \"Abby, Travis is destroying the apartment. Maybe he needs to visit a psychologist and talk his dead mommy/drunken father/rambunctious older brothers problems through.\" It\\'s, \"How could you do this to him, Abby?!\" Instead of, \"Why the fuck is an asshole with anger problems breaking into song in a cafeteria?\" everyone joins him in song. Nobody, not once (besides Abby herself a few times), questions why Travis addresses Abby as Pigeon at the end of every other sentence. I know that if I heard someone addressing someone as an ugly ass bird I would question the origins of that nickname. But no. Travis calls Abby \"Pigeon\" a total of 97 times and \"Pidge\" 28. HE GETS \"PIGEON\" TATTOOED ON HIS ARM. What the fuck is this book?!Abby Abernathy just sucks because she\\'s so damn stupid. She is so dumb that although taking Travis to Vegas was the cause of their most serious breakup, she decides she wants to go back there to marry him. In what way does that make sense? You don\\'t need to fly all the way to Vegas to vow yourself into a mistake marriage, you fucking idiot. It\\'s possible to go to a courthouse. I also don\\'t really understand her rationing for needing to stay at Travis and Shepley\\'s while the water heater was broken. She can just go there, shower, and go back to her dorm. That is possible. Apparently, none of the fucking characters in Beautiful Disaster were able to reach that conclusion themselves, though.The irritating thing about Abby is that she has her moments where she\\'s so close to a breakthrough. I remember specifically one time she was telling Travis they should take their relationship more slowly (naturally, he was on the brink of flying into a rage in response). That\\'s very good. It\\'s sensible. Then a couple chapters later she runs off to Vegas to get hitched and have herself \"branded\" as \"Mrs. Maddox.\" In what world does this make sense?The bottom line is that Beautiful Disaster is a shitty book. I could go on forever about it. I could post all the completely moronic pieces of the story I highlighted while reading, but it\\'s really not worth my time. I\\'ve read it twice, and I still fucking hate the book, and I still don\\'t see at all what other readers see that is so great. Believe it or not, this is not me bashing McGuire or her readers. While McGuire hasn\\'t made the most mature comments or blog posts, I\\'m sure she\\'s really a fantastic person. While I don\\'t have a fucking clue about what people see in this book, I don\\'t think less of a person for enjoying it - and don\\'t give me reason to by attacking me and telling me why you liked it. I don\\'t care. At all. I don\\'t want to hear about your love affair with this story. I don\\'t want you to list all the great things about it. You\\'re not going to change my opinion or the opinions of others who disliked it. If you want people to gush with, go comment on a 5-star review and save your time commenting on this one. I\\'ve quit reading all the comments anyway, and skim at best. TL;DR I hate this fucking book, I feel justified in hating it now because I gave it a second chance and it was worse reading it a second time, and nobody should waste their time reading this stupid book unless they\\'re really into reading about stupid motherfuckers with such deep co-dependency issues they can\\'t even function apart. -01/14/2012:I\\'ve just realized people are actually reading, commenting, and liking this review, and I feel like I should really review this book instead of angrily rant about it. So I\\'m (very slowly) going to force myself to reread Beautiful Disaster and hopefully be able to write a better review with fewer fucks. We\\'ll see.-11/17/2011:Beautiful Disaster: a total disaster.Talk about a book with seriously messed up people who can\\'t even function by themselves. These two are worse than even Edward and Bella. Abby and Travis are two absolutely psychotic people who should never have gotten together. Beautiful Disaster glorifies everything that should be discouraged in relationships. These two people are so fucked up. It\\'s portrayed as normal that, upon waking up alone, Travis completely destroys his apartment. He has outrageous jealousy issues and instead of being freaked the fuck out by that Abby is head over heels for him. Abby continuously makes the most idiotic damn decisions. These two fuckers have so many codependency issues that they can barely even function apart. Travis needs her in the room while he\\'s beating the shit out of people or he can\\'t even concentrate on punching the guy because he\\'s so distracted wondering what she\\'s doing. He literally threatens (if not beats up) EVERY. SINGLE. GUY. that looks at Abby--and that\\'s supposed to be attractive. This shit is all viewed as normal. Travis bursting out into song in the cafeteria prompts everyone to sing along. Everyone. What in the HELL? Not to mention the random mob plot line? Or how somehow Abby is a fucking moron but is a card-playing genius? OR HOW EVERY FUCKING CHARACTER THINKS IT FINE AND DANDY THAT TRAVIS TERRORIZES THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE.How in the HELL did this get nominated for Goodreads awards? Or any award ever? How was this even PUBLISHED? This love story is not normal. Stalkers are not good. I don\\'t know what the hell all these people rating it five stars and gushing over Travis are thinking, but if I dated someone who treated me like Travis treated Abby I would run for the fucking hills as fast as I could. And, last but not least:IF I HAD TO READ THE WORD \\'PIGEON\\' ONE. MORE. TIME...

The reviews for the book were SOOO incredibly misleading. I thought Travis was going to hit her, or come close, the way everyone was going on about the 'abuse' in the book. I get it, it was intense. But having seen real abuse with my own eyes, in real life..I didnt understand what everyone else saw that made it be worse and stand apart from all other books.This is a book about an alpha male. Just because it's not a paranormal book and instead, a contemporary, it's not ok for him to act like that? I'm a pretty (very) conservative person and I've read paranormal books where the guys act worse than that.Abby was the one who got on my nerves the most throughout the book for jerking Travis around all the time.

I stood my ground,staring straight into his eyes.\"Since when is sex so life or death to you?\" And Travis... \"Travis is a fucking wreck! He won’t talk to us, he’s trashed theapartment, threw the stereo across the room.Shep can’t talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It’s scaring me! Abby, he’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,\" she sighed.\"His face was… Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door... broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!\" Seriously Travis,I LOVE YOU,baby but you NEED TO GROW UP!!Be the Travis who never backs down from a challenge and say...GROW UP?

It\\'s as if Jamie McGuire reached into my brain, found my worst nightmare, wrote it down, and then charged me $13.99 to relive it. But that\\'s not all. I read this book on an 8-hour flight from London to Toronto. This book and I spent 8 hours together, in coach seating, with nothing to do but surrender to the impossibility of an escape. There was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, as this book stared up at me, begging to be read.\"Give me a chance,\" it said. \"Just because my author ostentatiously attacked reviewers like a spoiled brat last year during the Great War of Goodreads doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a heap of shit. Read me. Read me, bitch. Read me.\"I caved to the demands of the book, and am now a quivering wreck on the floor. I will proceed to chronicle my transition from literature enthusiast to broken shell of a woman below.Beautiful Disaster: A hallmark of passive aggressive literature that is secretly at home in the apocalyptic genreTake off: My spirits are high. The first page is fine, if a little poorly written. I make a note that this book kind of reads like fanfiction. Also making a strong effort not to blend the author\\'s tasteless actions last year with the content of the book. Also laughing at the ridiculous character names, but reminding self that neither \"America\" or \"Shepley\" is as bad as \"Eureka Boudreaux\".Growing distaste for random \"Pigeon\" nickname.Hour one: Surprised by route taken by book. There appears not to be instalove, which really shouldn\\'t be surprising, given the nature of the absolutely deplorable love interest who is a walking caricature of male privilege, misogyny and rape culture rolled into one physically unappealing package. Writing grinds on my nerves: excessive and contextless swearing, as well as random British words and phrases, pepper the text. Parker/Abby/Travis love triangle is unrealistic, twisted, and does not hang together. All Abby does is fuck Parker over, and all Travis does is fuck Abby over, and all Parker does is belittle Abby and walk around looking perfect, and no trouble stirs from this despite Travis and Parker being frat brothers? Why the fuck is Travis even in the fraternity, because all he does is beat the shit out of everyone? (Then again, this sort of antisocial clique mentality and culture of gender binary is what fraternities and sororities thrive on). Constant and aggressive misogyny against every other woman who shows interest in Travis is a motif within Abby\\'s narrative. They\\'re bimbo twins, or they\\'re short-skirted sluts, or they\\'re \"giving themselves up\". Of course, Travis engaging in promiscuous behaviour is sympathized with because he\\'s \"troubled\".Hour two: All sympathy for book waning. Abby and Travis revolve around each other like the doors at Macy\\'s and whine about loving each other but not being sure about the other person\\'s feelings, meanwhile the entire college watches them as if they are the centre of the universe and Abby shrugs off this fame while smoothing down her modest cardigan and flipping her modest hair like a \"good girl\".\"A really popular misogynist/date rapist is in love with me,\" she says, in front of an adoring freshman audience. \"But we\\'re just friends. Whatever. I don\\'t let it go to my head.\"Self-indulgent narrative sympathizes aggressively with dysfunctional central relationship and tries to convince reader that said dysfunctional central relationship is not abusive by addressing this threat of abuse through the lens of characters set up by the narrative to be villainous/bitchy/slutty. All women except those in committed relationships are portrayed as harpies. This 400-page book, narrated by a female character, written by a woman, just barely passes the Bechdel test.Hour three: Cabin fever sets in. The book and I stare each other down, with the seatbelt sign looming over our heads as a hellish omen sent to warn us of the impending five hours of the journey, in which we will remain locked in a turbulence-fuelled death grip at 40,000 feet. Determined not to succumb to the throes of insanity, I throw the book under the seat and watch Oz, The Great and Powerful. Movie is just as misogynistic and cheesy as book. Book finds its way back into my hands. I open it and go hard at it, determined to finish it in the next three hours. However, I am forced to gag into my white paper vomit bag when a sex scene with all the romantic appeal of the \"guts\" sequence from The Walking Dead blindsides me. I read another hundred or so pages filled with nothing but belly button fluff, and then the proverbial towel is thrown in again. (Bonus points for Travis trashing the apartment like a fucking gorilla in heat after Abby leaves in the morning without saying goodbye. Bonus bonus points for having Abby apologize for his appalling, violent, frightening behaviour.)Hour four: Insanity sings a siren song. I am barely able to hold on to my mind as a huge convoluted plot involving Vegas, poker and \"cronies\" springs up out of thin air. Abby and Travis break up because Travis wants to join the Mob (???), and the sun seems to shine again.Hour five: Abby and Travis fuck each other over again, constantly pussy-footing around the truth and their feelings. However, hilarity ensues when one realizes that they have broken up and Travis is stuck with \"Pigeon\" tattooed on his wrist. What a fucking idiot.(Aside: book seems to spookily endorse tattooing other people\\'s names and script related to other people\\'s names on one\\'s body. It is a very, very bad idea to tattoo another person\\'s name on your body. This is pretty much a renowned fact. Tattoo artists everywhere will strongly advise against it.)Abby and Travis fuck again in his father\\'s house (???) but they don\\'t get back together. Hour six: The plane has entered Canada and the end of the longest flight in history appears to be in sight. However, the book refuses to wrap up. There is more misogyny to be had, more violent behaviour from Travis, more pussy-footing, and a reunion which oozes with cheese. Side characters America and Shepley continue to be aggressively boring. Hour seven: weird fire-at-the-fighting-ring subplot appears, and fizzles away to nothing. Motif of weird fizzling subplots emerges and it becomes apparent that there is no plot to this book, only an abusive and codependent relationship and its hurdles. Nothing actually happens except a few immature and bratty kids behaving like dogs in heat, spattering period blood all over the floor and pissing on strangers\\' pant legs. They are the most inconvenient, self-absorbed and antagonistic group of people who all need a good, solid kick in the pants. (Bonus points for pretending to be inclusive by having a gay character. Yes, pretending. Book is not inclusive when book portrays a gay character as an extreme and commodified caricature with absolutely no expression of sexuality, no agency, and no reason for existence outside of consoling the main character when her straight romance breaks down.)Hour eight: Travis and Abby are married (!!!) in Vegas (!!!) at nineteen years old (!!!) which I suppose is meant to be a happy ending but in fact leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. Cheesiest scene in the history of the universe proceeds, along with fifty pages of surrounding filler. Book seems to drag on forever - chronicling Abby and Travis as they check in at the airport, as they drive somewhere, as they hug, and as they recycle the same conversation filled with sweet nothings that they have exchanged at least twenty times before. I am crying inside, begging for this ordeal to be over. When it is, a tsunami of relief washes over me. I arrive home, go to bed, and do not awaken for eleven hours.In conclusion: this book is not beautiful. This book is just a disaster.

In many ways this book is everything I hate in a Young Adult romance, but I still found myself enthralled, giddy, and starry eyed, regardless of how annoyed I became at time. In fact, I felt like I was at odds with myself during most of it. There was my latent teenage self, all starry eyed and idealistic, who loved everything about this book, warring with my more mature and realistic 40-year-old self who knows better. It became quite exasperating.I found I liked all the characters in this book. Not once did I become annoyed with them- shocking for a Young Adult story. The characters were multi-dimensional and authentic. I was easily transported into their world of college drama (although, frankly, it felt more like High School).Right from the start I fell head-over-heels in love with Travis. He\\'s such a lovable jerk. He epitomizes the charismatic, lackadaisical, tattooed, sexier-than-all-get-out bad boy over whom most young girls swoon. He\\'s volatile, tough, flirty, compulsive, charming, aggressive, shameless, intelligent, domineering, proud, and nonchalant. He also has a tenderhearted, kind and vulnerable side that makes it impossible not to love him. He really is the ultimate fantasy.Our book begins with Abby, our level-headed and strong-willed heroine, attending an underground college fight club where Travis \"Mad Dog\" Maddox is the undefeated champion. Unimpressed with his slick and smooth talking manner, she brushes him off, wanting nothing to do with him. Only too familiar with his type, she knows he means trouble. Travis, intrigued because Abby is immune to his charms, all but stalks her, wanting to win her over. Eventually he succeeds. What begins as a genuine friendship slowly blooms into an all consuming, passionate, and frankly, obsessive and codependent relationship.I really liked Abby\\'s character. I was braced to dislike her as the story progressed, fearing she would become little more than a doormat because of the codependent and obsessive relationship she had with Travis. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how level-headed she remained throughout the book. She confronted all of his “red flag” behaviors in a mature and rational manner, even leaving him for a time. The thing that makes this story both intriguing and appalling, is Travis\\' obsession with Abby. He is consumed by her. She becomes his everything. Exhilarating in theory; unhealthy in reality! His obsession, at times, becomes disturbing and worrisome. In the end Travis makes some behavioral changes, albeit more surface than substance, hoping to win Abby back. He succeeds, and Abby returns to the relationship. In doing so, some readers may believe in the misconception that one person can change another. While a part of me knows better I still loved so much about this book. I am a girl, after all! Would I want my 17 year old daughter to read this? No. Very few teens have either the experience or maturity to distinguish between fantasy and reality.But will I read this book again? Yes! (Oh dear, this makes me a hypocrite!)

Beautiful Disaster was a cluster eff of a read managing to throw everything I hate in a book into one novel.My first issue with this book are the characters. Our leading lady is Abby Abernathy. Then there\\'s our leading man Travis Maddox. I can capture my feels for both of them at the same time. I HATE THEM!!! I CAN\\'T STAND THEM!!!! Actually that really undersells how I feel towards them but whatever. Abby is DUMB! there is no other word I can use to describe her. I have never wanted to tear a characters hair out more than hers. She is such a plain character that turns out to be more boring than watching paint dry. It\\'s clear that the writer wanted to make it out to be that Abby would be this special snowflake but it was the fail of fails. Her sub story is that she comes from this terrible up-bringing... Even though the premise behind her tale was set up to be a success it too failed! This brings me to Travis... Oh God I don\\'t even know where to start with this this Patrick Bateman in training. This boy was two shakes of lambs tail away from cutting Abby up and making her into a skin suit. I would gladly let \"Mr. Grey see me now\" then let him touch me with a ten foot pole. He is creepy, abusive, controlling, scary, unattractive, cocky, and bizarre. This dude is beyond unstable. I also imagine him to be a mouth breather so that just adds to the growing list of reasons why I hate him. McGuire writes it so that Travis is this womanizing-college frat-man whore. Girls vagina literately bust out of their pants every time they see him. This causing me to roll my eyes so hard that they almost dislodged from my head! This leads me to problem two and three with this book. Maybe it\\'s just me (doubtful but maybe) but if I was about to hook up with a dude and I opened his bedside table and there was an endless amount of condoms and KY Jelly I would fly out of that room so fast that boy would think he was Dorthy... And if that didn\\'t make up my mind then the fact that he brings home not one, but TWO girls and sleeps with them in the living room while I\\'M IN HIS BED! would of had me never ever speaking to him again. NO GIRL IN HER RIGHT MIND WOULD HAVE SWEPT THAT UNDER THE RUG! The scene made me want to vomit then drink the cleaning products under my sink. Travis has major bipolar, drinking, jealousy, and personality issues. Travis also manages to keep Jesus abs the whole time without ever working out... This is even mentioned SEVERAL times in the book! HA NO! My fourth issue is the \"love triangle\"... It slightly reflected the same way the one from Twilight did, as in it was pointless. You never once think that Bella\\'s not going to choose Edward. Never once did you think. \"Wow Jacob might actually win the girl\", No! that doesn\\'t happen! Why this B would choose the travesty that is Travis over the handsome pre-doctor gentlemen is beyond me... Again, Maybe that\\'s just me. On to issue five, NO GUY NO GUY EVER!!!! WITH ANY AMOUNT OF PRIDE, STANDARDS, OR EVEN ONE WITH HALF A BRAIN WOULD LET THE GIRL THEY ARE COURTING SLEEP IN THE BED WITH ANOTHER MAN. You\\'re telling me that you still want to take this girl on a date even though she is living with another man and laying in bed with him every night (no the pre-doc wasn\\'t clueless to these acts)?!?!?! YOU STILL THOUGHT SHE\\'D END UP WITH YOU?!?! Please GTFOOH! No, there\\'s no way I\\'m believing this. I also don\\'t believe Abby could be dangling these two dudes by their balls when they both openly know she is bouncing between them like that white ball in a game of pong. Nope, again I just can\\'t! My sixth issue is the plot. It\\'s all over the place. It\\'s one spotty scene after another of Travis trying to dick measure with any and every guy. Once I heard this dude had tribal tattoos and was in an underground fight club (did I fail to mention this, YEAH HE IS IN A POOR EXCUSE FOR A FIGHT CLUB!!!) I should have known to put this book down... HMMMM TRAVIS I HATE TO BREAK IT TOO YOU BUT YOU ARE NO BRAD PITT. I also struggled to remember if this was high school or college... They had a set freaking lunch time!!! Did no one else catch that?! Oh and the fact that Travis kept beating the snot out of people with NO repercussions! WHERE THE EFF WAS THE PRINCIPAL DEAN??? OH and don\\'t get me started on the whole high-school musical sing along thing. (Seriously, what the hell did I just read?) No just No!My seventh and I think final issue (JK I could probably go on for days) with this book are the sub-characters. America is the worst best friend in history of friends. Shep is the worst family member in the history of the world. The only character that I thought made any sense was Kara!! She was the only character I liked. I kept screaming \"THANK YOU!\" every time she spoke! \"Do you know what codependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.\"Why Abby kept blowing her off also blew my mind.There were just so many things I couldn\\'t get behind. I know that the great part about books are that they can be anything. That they can go anywhere real or unrealistic. But this was just to far from either. I just can\\'t really get over how much I disliked everything about this book. The characters, weak. The plot, weaker. The romance, the weakest.Whatever walking deads on so I\\'m over this.

I\\'m imagining I\\'ve raised a few eyebrows with beginning this review on that note. You might be thinking \"Well, aren\\'t you being a little melodramatic, Rose? It\\'s just a book - it can\\'t possibly be that bad, right?\"*exhales slowly* Let me state for the record I\\'m a person who likes reading many different kinds of romances because I\\'m an avid reader and genres know no bounds with me, for the most part. I hesitated reading \"Beautiful Disaster\" because I was informed of issues with the book long before I picked up the e-galley and took the task of reading it in full.Books that glorify abusive relationships, especially if it\\'s veiled abuse and doesn\\'t give proper context nor knocks down the manipulative behavior, do not sit well with me. Nor do those that champion misogynistic ideals and present women in a negative light. Granted, as I mentioned before, I like a good romantic read. I also like books that deal with tough subjects and push the envelope when it comes to tackling a tough subject matter. I don\\'t mind those things, especially if they leave me with things to think about long after I\\'ve turned the last page of the book. Developed, rounded characters in the mix are a bonus as well. Prior to reading this book - what I\\'d read of Travis was that he\\'s a condescending, patronizing, controlling jerk who gets away with a lot in this book. (I could describe him in more crude terms, but I\\'m trying to keep that at a minimum in this reflection.) And it\\'s not necessarily knocked down by the passive heroine who actually does have another guy who cares about her and treats her well, but the portrayal is never equivocated because all the while, Travis comes up as the obvious horse in the love triangle race. If one could even call it a true triangle. And the heroine never focuses on the wrong that Travis does, but rather focuses on all the other external elements (other women, etc.) as being wrong.I could open the floor and ask a simple question: why do people find personalities like Travis to be romantic? I ask that question sincerely in a manner of discourse, because I don\\'t understand the attracting factor of someone who would go to such lengths to control what a woman wears, who she sees, where she resides, and practically throw a fit if she deviates from those restrictions. People argue that Travis is not abusive, but there are more dimensions to abuse than just physical context (despite the fact that he tears up a room in response to the heroine\\'s actions in one scene of the book). What little I had skimmed in BD\\'s snippets and also read in other reviews had abuse of another sort - mental and emotional. The heroine keeps being drawn back into Travis\\'s influence, though it\\'s clear on several counts that there are moments when she wants to get the heck away from him, but then turns around and commends his behavior in implied gestures. It\\'s not made okay by the fact that Travis starts singing in the middle of a certain setting \"I Can\\'t Get No Satisfaction\" or the fact that he buys her a puppy. He might have moments of good, but the larger impressions of the novel were that his influence is negative and the heroine desires him in light of that negativity.That was the initial reason why I passed on this book for content rationale. My experience with McGuire\\'s first novel in her \"Providence\" trilogy didn\\'t sit well with me either. But curiosity has never let me lie in peace when it comes to a book. So when I saw this available as an e-galley, I decided to swallow my qualms and go for it.The experience was worse than I\\'d initially believed it to be. There has been debate with this novel as a self-published work as to what genre it fell under, given its respective thematic and the frank content of Abby and Travis\\' relationship. McGuire herself had stated that it was once a mature YA title (which I would adamantly refute given the strong language, sexual, and discretionary content of the book). It\\'s been since marketed as an adult contemporary romance.There\\'s also a question that I think might raise a few other eyebrows that I\\'m going to explore: Is it really a romance novel? The knee-jerk reaction might be akin to: \"Of course it\\'s a romance novel! What else would it be? It\\'s showing a dysfunctional relationship between two trainwreck lovers who are meant to be together and weather all kinds of hardships and such to ultimately be one.\"I\\'ll give a single initial argument though - just as food for thought. When the dysfunction becomes more than the love, where is the line drawn between it being a romance or a staged drama in prose form? It\\'s true that people do crazy things when in love and act in the veil of desperation - sometimes going through something akin to the five stages of grief before coming to terms with the heart of their true sentiments (and there\\'s plenty of that to go around in this book). Yet when it becomes so manufactured that the people inside the story don\\'t act in the way that the character would act given their personality traits and knowledge in the book, and the author\\'s obviously playing the puppeteer strings to skew it to a certain result, it can make the experience sour faster than week-old milk. And while I would say in romance literature, many may see the experience as escapist...manufacturing a storyline to milk its drama doesn\\'t do anyone any favors.Which is why I wasn\\'t buying what \"Beautiful Disaster\" sold.Abby Abernathy is a college freshman who meets Travis \"Mad Dog\" Maddox at a fighting match in which he\\'s a participant. To say their relationship gets off to a rocky start would be an understatement. Abby\\'s quick to push him away because of his reputation, perception of his tattoos, and perceived sexual promiscuity. And Travis, bad boy extraordinaire, can\\'t help but be drawn to Abby in her innocence and challenge to shove him away. Their relationship is further drawn together since they know people in the same circles. Abby\\'s friend America (Mare) and America\\'s boyfriend, Shep, are just two examples. America has to be the most inconsistent best friend I\\'ve read, because she goes back and forth between passionately wanting Abby to be a part of Travis\\'s life and thinking Abby is the only one who can \"right\" him, and also thinking it\\'s best if Abby stays the heck away before she gets hurt.Suffice to say, in the course of the story, Abby and Travis have a lot of on-again/off-again relations. That normally wouldn\\'t bother me in a romance novel. It happens even in real life. Given the context of this novel, however, I was horrified and made numb by it.Abby is a passive heroine crafted in the guise of proactive by her incendiary attitudes towards Travis. There\\'s really very little to no background given on her to round her character. It took me five chapters to realize what she was studying at her college, let alone a good bit of the novel to know anything about her family (and when that comes to light, it\\'s fairly reminiscent of McGuire\\'s other, latter penned novel \"Providence\" - heroine has father issues, father\\'s associated with criminal activity, etc.) I think that disconnect was what made it hard to truly sympathize with her, aside from some harrowing moments where she\\'s desperately getting away from her relationship with Travis and facing some antagonism from other sources (a near rape, a fire, etc.).Travis - again, I do not understand why he\\'s a desirable male lead. He takes on the typical \"bad boy who\\'s hurting\" trope, and while I actually do tend to like alpha males who are in pain and sometimes lash out for genuine reasons, Travis never has any kind of development to justify his actions, let alone does he face the repercussions of them. It\\'s clear he has issues like his boiling anger, propensity to hit anything that gets in his way or offends \"his girl,\" and some jarring examples of insensitivity to anyone but himself and his needs. There are moments penned where it\\'s made to seem like he\\'s being cute, but the majority of the time he\\'s creepy, clingy, needy, and self-absorbed. There\\'s a false guise of self-awareness given in the book when he acknowledges to Abby that he\\'s \"messed up\", but never seems to learn from his actions. There\\'s a part of me that wondered if he was suffering from (and I\\'m being very serious here) a mental disorder that made him as such. It would\\'ve been helpful if maybe McGuire had the insight to delve into that part of his character more, but it never shows. Not once. Travis\\'s actions are often glorified and made okay by Abby\\'s abrupt about face. No expansion given.Examples? Here are some:He walks into the bathroom one scene while she showers. Abby\\'s horrified one moment and then suddenly finds the gesture cute.He calls her Pidge - it\\'s given as a nickname (which she isn\\'t initially affectionate toward) and is supposedly a reference to the Disney film Lady and the Tramp, but that\\'s never given in the context of the book. Very rarely does he allude to her real name, and when he does, it\\'s often to mock her or mock someone else discussing her (with the effect of guilt tripping her).He totals his apartment after Abby leaves the day after a bet they made together expires (requiring her to stay at his place for a month). They just so happened to have sex the night before, and she leaves the next morning without telling him. She\\'s blamed by pretty much everyone that she was the cause of his tantrum and she accepts it.Travis also gets desperate and chases her back home after a stint in Vegas and wanting to fight there for a mobster in order to obtain money. Abby\\'s upset by it because her father was involved in that line of work and she doesn\\'t want to go through the hurt and pain she endured from her father\\'s involvements. Travis tries to restrain her, storms into the apartment with her roommate, and she has to hide from him until he \"calms down.\"How is that love? How is that respect?There are other factors to consider here as well. Let\\'s take it from the perspective of the man who, for a time, is set to be the \"other\" love interest in this novel. Meet Parker - a high achieving, Med-school aspiring student who seems like a nice guy, even if he seems like a bit of a Gary Stu initially considering his wealth and intelligence (and the diamond bracelet gift does seem a bit presumed as Abby\\'s birthday gift for the duration of their initial relationship). But one can tell he\\'s genuinely attracted to Abby - he treats her well, is even patient when he\\'s sidelined by her. You can\\'t help but feel bad for this guy after a point because he\\'s pretty much a pawn in the \"Travis and Abby\" show. It\\'s not a real love triangle because, where Parker\\'s in the picture, either Abby, Parker himself, or someone else brings Travis up as the topic of conversation/comparison. It\\'s not realistic. What frustrated even more is that I felt McGuire\\'s authorial voice often intruded with the relations between Abby and Parker where Travis was used as the comparison. It was as if it were set up to failure from point one. The way Abby treats Parker broke my heart, because either there\\'s a hateful comment he makes that\\'s decidedly out of character (and McGuire\\'s intruding voice) in an attempt to make Travis look like the better guy, or there\\'s a point where Travis or Abby completely skewer the guy for trying to use reason, or for just being who he is.The only two characters I can say I actually liked consistently through the work were Finch and Kara, though their respective roles were very small in the overarching novel.The events of the novel themselves are problematic, but let me take a moment to discuss the writing and thematic. (I mentioned misogyny in this novel, so I\\'ll go a bit into it as well here.) It\\'s one of those reads that can be quickly digested, but it\\'s poorly written. Awkward dialogue tags (other than \"said\" or \"asked\"), stilted dialogue, choppy phrasing - all things that could\\'ve been avoided with thorough editing. The thematic of this book bothered me considering the misogynistic language that\\'s prevalent in this. If not just for the events themselves (i.e. Travis dropping a woman from his lap after she insults Abby or Travis saying that he wouldn\\'t want his future daughter to open her legs for a man so easily), then the language left something to be desired with frequent slut shaming, causal throws of \"bitches\" and \"hos\" and such. I\\'m not a stranger to crude language in a work, but some of these were championed for obvious humor purposes, and they didn\\'t come across as humorous or realistic at all to me.So, in sum, I think \"Beautiful Disaster\" didn\\'t contain much beauty to it at all. I\\'ll end on the note that after reading the book, I see the symbolism of the cover with a butterfly being kept in a jar. The sad thing about is that, when you think about the image in a sense, a romanticized version of it may mean that it\\'s beauty captured and contained from the rest of the world. But the reality, the longer that butterfly is contained from its habitat and not left to wander free to experience the world, it suffocates, withers, and dies. I think that Abby and Travis\\'s relationship is, indeed, a suffocating presence that doesn\\'t have any true romantic notions at all, and I deign to think it represents anything that could be construed as healthy or desirable.Overall score: 0.5/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher S&S/Atria Books.

No Spoilers. The book Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire has been all around the Blogosphere lately. It became available on Netgalley and many bloggers are currently reading it. This book has caused many controversy and has earned some really nasty reviews, still, the book has an average rating of 4.13. I recently stumbled upon a review that said very very no-so-nice things about Beautiful Disaster, and it also mentioned that everyone that rated this book with 5 stars was a @%#^&!#$% and insane. Well Hello! I\\'m a @%#^&!#$% and apparently also insane because I gave the book 5 Fat Stars. So sue me.And now I am taking the time to make a second review for Beautiful Disaster explaining why I think this book was great and why I don\\'t think it was a book encouraging abusive relationships and blah blah. REVIEW OF BEAUTIFUL DISASTER - TAKE TWO. *Scroll Down for my original review of Beautiful DisasterI\\'m picking up my sword and helmet because I know lots of people won\\'t agree with me. Anyways, here I go. *deep breath**Point One - Travis is an abusive and violent asshole.I disagree. Yes, there is a scene in the book where he trashes his place because of a few situations with Abby where she left and lots of drama. Yes, that was violent but I don\\'t think it was completely and utterly scandalous. Some guys tend to break or hit things when they\\'re angry, NOT people. I have 3 older brothers; One of them would always, always hit a wall when he was angry, hence, he always had a broken wrist. One of my other brothers would simply go to his room in silence and do nothing but stay dead silent, he would shut down. I cried, and Yelled to my pillow, and cried some more. My mom throws things at people, I\\'m not even kidding, every time mom got angry we all just yelled \"Duck!\" luckily she always missed - I still Love you mom! - So maybe Travis\\'s way of releasing stress wasn\\'t the best and maybe it was a bit over the top and you would consider it violent, but he never, EVER was violent towards Abbey in the book. Ever.*Point Two - The Abusive and Twisted relationship of Travis and Abby.Their relationship was probably not the best of the world. It was, in fact, a Disaster. And the author knows it and she mentions it in the book and wrote it in the title.“It\\'s dangerous to need someone that much. You\\'re trying to save him and he\\'s hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\" I smiled at the ceiling. \"It doesn\\'t matter what or why it is. When it\\'s good, Kara... it\\'s beautiful.”-Beautiful DisasterI don\\'t think that the Author - or anyone for that matter, would ever encourage an abusive relationship. EVER. Abby and Travi\\'s relationship is very very far from perfect, but the beauty in it is that they both become the best versions of themselves when being together, and I think that\\'s what relationships are all about: being with someone that inspires you to be better each and every day.“You know why I want you? I didn’t know I was lost until you found me. I didn’t know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You’re the one thing I’ve got right. You’re what I’ve been waiting for\"-Beautiful DisasterYou are not supposed to enter into a relationship thinking the other person can save you or that you can save the other person. Because, eventually, if you think you\\'re doing the saving, you\\'ll probably realize that it\\'s not possible and they\\'ll become a weight on your shoulder. If you think you can be saved by the other, you\\'ll realize no one can really save you but yourself. In the first quote mentioned, Travis thinks he can be save and, guess what? the relationship fails. It isn\\'t until BOTH of them deal with their issues and learn their lessons that they get back together. And they are still not perfect, because perfection does not exist.*Point Three - The JealousyTravis is a very jealous guy. This is what I think about Jealousy:“A person shows signs of clutching on too fast, of being needy, of not hearing the word \"no,\" of jealousy, of guarding you and your freedom. But the signs can be so small they skitter right past you. Sometimes they dance past, looking satiny, something you should applaud. Someone\\'s jealousy can make you feel good. Special. But it\\'s not even about you. It\\'s about a hand that is already gripping. It\\'s about their need, circling around your throat”- Deb Caletti, StayNo one could have said it better than Deb Caletti. Huge HUGE flaw in Travis, and I\\'ll say it again: the relationship fails until he\\'s able to pull his shit together. *Point Four - A Bad Book.This book will never be at a Shakespeare lever, that\\'s for sure, but it\\'s not a bad book with bad messages to YA readers. I think the exact opposite. The author made this story for a reason, made the characters that way for a reason, and gave the book that title for a reason. And I honestly think that when you place everything together, aside from being a good entertaining story, this book turns out to be genius in a quiet way. I really did get a lot of things out of this book, and I know that many many of you won\\'t share the same thoughts and feelings with me, and that\\'s perfectly normal, we\\'re not the same and we don\\'t think the same way. But I definitely felt the need to explain this because I don\\'t like the assumptions they are making of us Beautiful Disaster Lovers. Now I wave my 5 star flag with pride because this book - in my eyes - earned every single one of them. And I shall be forever grateful to Jennifer from Some Like It Paranormal and Header from Nightly Reading for insisting on me reading this book.and now going back to fan-girl mode: OH MY GOD!!! I Cannot wait for Walking Disaster!!!! Which is Beautiful Disaster told in Travis POV!!! *SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAL* MY FIRST REVIEW OF BEAUTIFUL DISASTER. This book was so good, so so so good! and the ending was so Incredibly Happy and Good that it seemed unrealistic....Let me explain my situation: I\\'m sure we\\'ve all had a friend when we were young that was in a relationship and swore they were going to get married and you were like \"Pfft, yeah right, you\\'ll break up eventually, you\\'ll see.\" Something similar happened with me and this book, I was like \"Pfft, yeah right, nobody gets such a happy ending. Pfft.\" Which really pisses me off! I used to be a hopeless romantic and now I\\'ve become un-romantic and disgustingly realistic. and it\\'s not even realistic because Happy endings DO exist. We\\'re just all too blind to see them. Society killed good romance and Happily Ever After But then I got to talking with lovely BF Jennifer from Some Like It Paranormal and I was ranting about how I was such a pessimist and she said [Quote] \"Yeah I\\'m a big pessimist but I love my HEA! I don\\'t care how unrealistic, an author should end things nicely otherwise I\\'m all upset and can\\'t eat dinner!\" So Screw being a pessimist! Screw it I say! I will enjoy this Happy Ending and give this book the 5 Stars it Deserves! It was a great and addicting story! I Loved it! and I want One Just like it! [well, we can keep a few situations out, I guess] The story was full of great elements, for example Abby mentions she has a troubled past, but you will never come close to guessing what she\\'s running away from, I was very surprised and pleased when I found out, not your average situation. Moving on to Travis: Swoon worthy guy [Duh] Strong, with Tattoos and trouble trouble trouble. He was way to jealous at times for my taste and very violent [though never towards Abby] also very much of a jerk at times but, you can see he tries really hard to be better, which gives him bonus points. Abby was also driving me nuts at times, BOTH of them drove me nuts during the book, they were perfect for each other and they were both too stupid to see it, but it was never annoying and it only made me want to read faster! Spoiler Note, if you haven\\' read the book don\\'t you dare see it! it\\'ll ruin a really cool/cheesy/stupid part in the book! (view spoiler)[When he gets a tattoo with her name seemed stupid to me, waaaaaay beyond the valley of sanity. also when she gets one at the end.... Still, it was pretty cheesy/corny/stupid and I liked it x) also I love the ending when she reminds him never to bet against her, I really do think that gave the book a nice guarantee that they will get a happily ever after. After all, you simply don\\'t bet against Lucky 13 ;) (hide spoiler)]In conclusion: this book was Incredible. And the title could not describe it better, it\\'s a Beautiful Disaster, because even though their relationship was, well, a Disaster, it was still Beautiful, Travis being the best version of himself he could be when he was with Abby, wanting to be the right guy and making the right choices, and Abby learning to take chances and also that sometimes life has other plans for you, and that this plans are often the best choice. An Amazing book that it\\'s worth keeping and re-reading. You won\\'t forget it.

I actually believe this may be the worst book I have ever read. The characters are poorly developed, the writing style just appalling, I never really understood their motivations and the narrative never gave them time to react to situations. This felt like it had been written by a twelve year old to me.This takes place over 2 semesters at college. Travis is a manwhore student who earns his money by bare knuckle fighting. He treats women terribly - very much wham bam thank you ma'am and kick her out the door 2 seconds later. Inexplicably, the moment he sees Abby, he falls in love and calls her pigeon - a rather scabby rodent like bird. Abby has a past she wants to escape - her Father was a successful poker player whose luck ran out when Abby turned 13 and so he hates her now! I soooo didn't get that either. The characters make decisions that just had me all WTF?? It just doesn't make any sense. It's possibly the worst character development I have ever seen in a novel. Anyway, the story stumbles from situation to situation - Travis is goofily in love and will savagely beat any guy that looks at Abby sideways. We have descriptions of him holding someone on the floor and repeatedly smashing his fist in their face more than once. That's not protective - that's downright violent and could actually result in a serious brain injury. And this is aimed at a YA readership with Travis cast as a 'hero'?? WTF?The sex scene where Travis takes Abby's virginity is absolutely forgettable. I know she begs for it but he just ruts away on top of her with no thoughts of her pleasure or even preparing her to make it easier for her. He's pretty shit in bed to be fair and I was quite shocked he didn't have more pride in his performance given that he's had so much experience.Travis appears to be harbouring some serious schizophrenic tendencies - perhaps he has actually sustained a serious brain injury in one of those fights? That might well explain his truly ridiculous character and decisions and reactions to situations - or could that possibly be just do to the poor character development on behalf of this writer. Travis is not one of the good guys. He is not a hero. There is nothing endearing about his character at all. He is one of those nasty, jealous, possessive, violent guys that will beat the supposed love of his life senseless just because she glances at another man or he glances at her. Abby's future is likely to be fraught with peril, on edge constantly with what Travis will think about what she is wearing, who she is talking to and what she is doing. She will be so scared of upsetting him, it will totally rule her life. Someone needs to tell Abby to get out and to get out quick before he beats her to a pulp because he surely will. I fully accept f*cked up characters in books but this guy is written as a 'hero' and he is aimed at the YA audience. Horrific!! To think that a girl of Abby's age could think that Travis is some kind of romantic hero is pretty scary and a pretty appalling message to be sending out to this book's target demographic. I'm real sorry that I didn't get this - I can see that this story is so well loved by so many here but it really wasn't for me. To this day I just cannot even begin to understand why so many people here that I respect have given it 5 stars. What in the world do you all see here that I just can't? It completely baffles me. It's not even halfway good. I'd like to add that it's really not often that I leave reviews like this but I felt so strongly that this book is sending THE most appalling message of accepting violent tossers as heroes to it's young readers that I felt compelled to speak out against it. \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/265410318?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Aestas Book Blog', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog', 'Sep 08, 2011', 'it was amazing', '223', \" “I need to hear you say it. I need to know you’re mine.”“I’ve been yours since the second we met.” ooooo *sigh* what can I say about this book except that its reeeeally good, HIGHLY addictive and utterly captivating. You literally feel compelled to keep turning the pages. You just can't stop. No joke!Abby and Travis meet in college. He's a tough, charming, insanely hot, tattooed badboy who also is a womanizing A student who fights in a ring at night and once he meets Abby, he's just captivated by her. Abby is a good girl, no drinking, no swearing, pretty much just his complete opposite. Despite their differences, they are somehow drawn to each other other. “I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn’t something about you at all. It was just you.” He makes a deal with her where if he can remain abstinent for a month, she has to live with him for a month. They become friends before they become lovers but its clear that they are meant to be together. Travis thinks to highly of Abby to initially be with her. He doesn't feel worthy of her. And in the book, we get to watch that change as it becomes more and more impossible for them to not be together. “To douchebags!” he said, gesturing to Brad. “And to girls that break your heart,” he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. “And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her.”Its weird, there were a lot of things in this story that normally bother me a little, but for whatever reason, I just loved it here. I couldn't get enough of this book!I fell in love with how fiercely protective Travis was of Abby. He may have gone overboard a few times but it made me totally swoony! This is a book after all, and in books we accept things that may not work in real life but that, in a story context, just make your heart race! “You can’t tell me what to do anymore, Travis! I don’t belong to you!” In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. “WELL I BELONG TO YOU!” The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch. He looked at my lips, panting. “I belong to you.” I loved Travis' character. He was flawed, oh so flawed, but his heart was in the right place. I love a guy who is sure of who he loves, not afraid to defend them, and will try as hard as he can to prove himself.This book is fast paced and action packed. There are no slow or dull points. The writing is smooth and sucks you right into the story - puts you right there with the characters. It is heart racing and heart breaking and has a HEA. “-It’s over. Go home.-You’re my home.” I loved watching the journey that the characters went through - watching Travis change and become a better person, watching Abby come to terms with her past and watching the two of them fall head over heals in love. I'm unfortunately writing this review months after I originally read the book but all I know is that this book is sitting on my favs shelf and will definitely be re-read at some point. I'd definitely call this a MUST read for any fan of badboy romances.Here's how I see Travis & Abby (ps, I know Travis is supposed to have a buzz-cut so lets just mentally shave the hair on the guy on the top right cuz I love the look of him for Travis despite the slightly longer hair lol):For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog Facebook Page \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/206653134?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)', 'Torie', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2313749-torie', 'Jul 03, 2011', 'really liked it', '213', ' WARNING: THIS BOOK IS LIKE CRACK Because you feel like such shit for reading it, but you can\\'t stop yourself from reading it anyway. There were more typos than I could count, the dialogue is just so cheesy it\\'s cringe-worthy, the boy is such a Gary-Sue, BUT...oh my Lord I could NOT stop myself. I was so grossed out by myself for liking it, my boyfriend was grossed out by me liking it, but I couldn\\'t pull myself away! The Issues The boy is a character OBVIOUSLY conjured by a woman and a HUGE Gary Sue! He\\'s a bad-boy that\\'s superb at fighting, but he\\'s still a genius that doesn\\'t have to work towards school. How convenient! No one can beat him at a fight and no girl can pass him without shamelessly throwing herself at him. The only flaw he really seems to have is his inability to control his anger and his violent tendencies (which apparently make him all the more appealing), but other than that, he\\'s pretty peachy keen. He has a sob story, which isn\\'t really all that sad, but McGuire was trying to fault him somewhere--anywhere--and his lack of a mother seemed good enough. He says all the right things, that are so incredibly cheesy, and it makes me wince every time I read them.The girl is a special little snowflake. I didn\\'t really hate her, and I didn\\'t quite love her, but since I was saddled with her, I chose to quietly accept her as a narrator. Her decisions were so stupid sometimes and so ridiculous, that it was unbelievable. Like, I wanted to hit her and say, \"Really? Why are you such a wuss? Why are you so weak? Why do you keep running?\" Her sob story wasn\\'t really that sad either, but I guess EVERYONE has to have a sad backstory in this tale. Ugggh. I did not sympathize with her at all. It was such an absurd sob story that I like really could care less. The cliches run so rampant throughout the book! The only girl who refuses the sexy bad boy is the one he wants the most. Why? I don\\'t know! Nothing really stands out about her other than she wears short dresses and gets drunk a lot. I guess that\\'s hot for boys. I\\'ll take note! If a boy hits on you, try to repel him by being bitchy, ugly, and distant and he will LOVE YOU even if he denies everyone else! The foil to the boy was horribly developed. He did not prove a strong antagonist because all Abby would describe him as is \"rich, cute and charming,\" so we don\\'t really learn much about him other than that. Like, what are we going to do with the fact that he\\'s going to go to Harvard?? It\\'s too obvious that he\\'s supposed to be the polar opposite of Travis\\' \"wrong side of the tracks\" lifestyle (and supposedly the right choice for Abby), and therefore makes it too obvious who she\\'s going to choose. Why I loved it anyway The narrator was annoying, but she wasn\\'t THAT bad. Sometimes I enjoyed her quips, and I sure as hell enjoyed the smutty scenes (Mcguire, you sure can write some good smut!), but what I really loved were the supporting characters. Loved America! Though, to be completely honest, I\\'ve never heard of a blonde girl named America before. I love when girls actually have supportive girl friends rather than destructive ones. It\\'s a refreshing change and I loved it. Shep was really minor and off to the side, so I can\\'t really talk about him since he just pops in when it\\'s convenient. I like the whole fighting idea and some of the plot turns were really fun to read. Travis may have been a Gary Sue, but aside from all the CHEESINESS he oozed, you get to like some of the stuff he says and does. But seriously, SO MUCH CHEESE. THE DIALOGUE MADE ME WANT TO CLAW MY EYES OUT. UGH.Still, I enjoyed it and I absolutely hate myself for it.

I never get anything right, and i don\\'t deserve you…but i fucking love you, Abby. I love you more than I\\'ve loved anyone or anything, ever. When you\\'re around, I don\\'t need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands… all I need is you. You\\'re all think about. You\\'re all I dream about. You\\'re all I want.okay, well i understand the disaster part... and if i am honest, i can see how some readers would find this beautiful. i, personally, find this relationship one of the most toxic ones this side of gone girl, but i can see how someone who is young, inexperienced in relationships, and possibly living somewhere a little sheltered would see this as terribly romantic.\"It\\'s just me and you against the world, Pidge.\"i know i talk about wuthering heights like it\\'s the only book i have ever read. but i just keep coming back to it because it serves as a template for so many of these all-consuming passionate love stories. the first time i read wh, i was fifteen, and i didn\\'t have the life or relationship-perspective i have now. and reading it at that age, all i saw was heathcliff. this dark brooding man who loved enduringly with all of his being, and i sighed and thought, \"how romantic.\" i didn\\'t see what a bitch cathy was or how heathcliff\\'s love for her was terrifying - i only saw the capital r romance. and then as my sphere of experience grew, i was better able to see what was really happening, and how they were both terrible, selfish people who only became their best selves when they were together; everything else they touched, they destroyed. their love is a horrible, destructive thing, but it is theirs, and it is the only one that will ever work for either of them. a wuthering heights-type relationship, when situated on the isolated moors, in a time where communication with the greater world was essentially nil, makes sense. in a modern-day setting, where women have options… it just doesn\\'t. but i can understand why a reader younger than myself would read this relationship as passionate instead of unstable. and having been in a relationship with someone with a jealous side and someone else who was prone to dramatic and violent acts in the name of love (of the room-destroying variety, not any hitting of me, dad), i understand that willful blindness that can interpret a room-trashing in a flattering light, and is attracted to the unpredictability and the demonstrative aspects of a passion that oversteps acceptable social mores. it is exciting to be able to elicit such a response in someone, no?? it means they care, yes? i\\'m old enough now to find it childish and wearying, but i get it, i do.but i still can\\'t see travis as a love-interest. i hold grudges. and i am capable of forgiving, but i never never forget, and i have always had a sort of overdeveloped sense of my own worth, and have filtered out potential lovers who threaten my dignity. these, to me, are deal-breakers:1) man barges into the bathroom while you are showering. not post-coitally, or even once a relationship has been established, but who has opened his doors to you out of \"kindness\" because you temporarily do not have hot water at your place. not cool, travis. bad host.2 ) man sleeps with half the females on campus and dismisses them with an ass-smack in front of you. this diminishes you as a potential love-interest, or even an intercourse-interest. no one wants to be a headboard-notch.Travis rounded the corner in a pair of boxer shorts and yawned. He looked at his guest and then patted her backside.\"My company\\'s here. You\\'d better go.\"She smiled and wrapped her arms around him, kissing his neck. \"I\\'ll leave my number on the counter.\"\"Eh…don\\'t worry about it,\" Travis said in a casual tone.\"What?\" she asked, leaning back to look in his eyes.\"Every time!\" America said. She looked at the woman. \"How are you surprised by this? He\\'s Travis Fucking Maddox! He is famous for this very thing, and every time they\\'re surprised!\" and this is from girl who still wants her best friend and travis to be together. some friend. a sane person would automatically eliminate him from the dating-pool.3) will not take these women into his room or bed - he sleeps with them on the couches in the communal area of the apartment. dude, people have to sit on those to watch t.v.! it is just selfish and discourteous to the people with whom you live, and it is a very telling indication of your lack of respect for your conquests.4) childish displays of displeasure like travis trashing his room after abby leaves without saying goodbye. again - i understand how this can translate into a mystique of uncontrolled emotions and exciting dangerous elements, but it\\'s just - no. use your words, travis.5) emotionally underdeveloped and erratic. before abby, travis was all love-\\'em-and-leave-\\'em with this very studied and disingenuous posturing. not a spoiler, but a long passage that you may or may not want to read:(view spoiler)[Travis stood behind the breakfast bar, crossed his arms over his chest, and smiled. \"What\\'s wrong, Pidge? Hard day?\"No, I\\'m thoroughly disgusted.\"\"With me?\" He was smiling. I should have known that he expected this conversation. It only made me less inclined to hold back.\"Yes, you. How can you just use someone like that and treat them that way?\"\"How did I treat her? She offered her number, I declined.\"My mouth fell open at his lack of remorse. \"You\\'ll have sex with her, but you won\\'t take her number?\"Travis leaned on the counter with his elbows. \"Why would I want her number if I\\'m not going to call her?\"\"Why would you sleep with her if you\\'re not going to call her?\"\"I didn\\'t promise anyone anything, Pidge. She didn\\'t stipulate a relationship before she spread-eagled on my couch.\"I stared at the couch with revulsion. \"She\\'s someone\\'s daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?\"\"My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let\\'s put it that way.\"I crossed my arms, angry that he\\'d made sense. \"So, besides admitting that you\\'re a jackass, you\\'re saying that because she slept with you, she deserved to be tossed out like a stray cat?\"\"I\\'m saying that I was honest with her. She\\'s an adult, it was consensual…she was a little too eager about it, if you want to know the truth. You act like i committed a crime.\"\"She didn\\'t seem as clear about your intentions, Travis.\"Women usually justify their actions with whatever they make up in their heads. She didn\\'t tell me up front that she expected a relationship any more than I told her I expected sex with no strings. How is it any different?\"\"You\\'re a pig.\"Travis shrugged. \"I\\'ve been called worse.\" (hide spoiler)]SO many things wrong with that passage. SO many. and this scene is exactly one page before that walking in on her in the shower scene, where he goes through her luggage and brings her the things he thinks she will need for her ablutions. and despite that explosive scene THAT JUST HAPPENED, her reaction to this is, after the initial reasonable reaction of \"get the fuck out, you perv,\" is He was thoughtful and almost nice when he wanted to be.which is moronic, but the point is that even though he has lived that casual sex lifestyle and been disgusted by the women who put out \"too eagerly,\" once he and abby get together and he becomes the redeemed beast to her beauty, he becomes soooo clingy. which - once a woman has foolishly succumbed to your bad-boy charm, is a complete bait-and-switch, and no one wants that, even without all the other bullshit.6) evidence of protection or no, sleeping with a different woman every night of the week is just a dangerous guy to hook up with. 7) watching her sleep. again, this is excusable once a relationship has been established, but when people are platonically sharing a bed, it is uncomfortable at best.i realize i have not gone into much plot detail, so some of this probably makes no sense, but i\\'m already afraid i am going to exceed the space allotted to write this review (or response) and i figure most people bothering to read this have either 1) read the book or 2) have already made up their minds not to, so it\\'s what i\\'m doing. other bullshit things travis does:vagblocking abby\\'s flirtations with other men while being himself a manwhore, like bringing home two women one evening to intercourse while abby is waiting for him in the bedroom, is unacceptable. right, because it\\'s other guys who treat women poorly and he\\'s just looking out for her best interests.taking drinks out of her hand and throwing themtelling her to change before they go out in public because he doesn\\'t want other men looking at her when she is looking sexy. again - they are not together at this point. oh, and she changes. dumbass.dragging her out of a car when she comes home from a date with another guy\"Why did you do that?\" I asked.\"Why? Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!\" he yelled. His eyes were unfocused, and I could see he was incapable of rational conversation.I kept my voice calm. \"I may be staying with you, but what I do, and who I do it with is my business.\" He flicked his cigarette to the ground. \"You\\'re so much better than that, Pidge. Don\\'t let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.\"right. let him fuck you on a couch. is classier. god, none of these characters have any self-awareness. travis in this and other scenes, and abby in most of her scenes. there\\'s a lot of this:why do people think i am dating travis?? is it because we walk around campus holding hands or with our arms around each other and he has stopped flirting with/bedding other girls and i sleep in his bed?? that\\'s just because we are friends! and i lost a bet!! i can\\'t believe everyone is talking about me like i am a slut just because i sleep in one guy\\'s bed while publicly dating another boy. i\\'m a virgin for goodness\\' sake! and i don\\'t like it when women say bad things about other women (me), even though i have spent most of the book judging the girls that travis beds and calling them clueless bimbos. i\\'m a virgin with a virgin\\'s disdain for other women\\'s expressive sexualities but no one has the right to talk about me even though i am behaving like a complete tease. (not an actual quote, but an unauthorized synopsis)in college, sure, i slept in many beds of boys and girls platonically, and not because of any bet, but because it was all innocent puppy-piling after raves or parties or whatever (feel free to just glide over the word \"rave.\") but never with someone i knew was into me, because i am not cruel, and i never embraced that casual nudity thing, while these two act like a long-married couple in this weird sexless domestic arrangement and then act surprised when something is made of it in gossipville.more bad behavior:dragging her away from a date in order to drag her to one of his fights because he needs her there. \"no, parker, we are not involved, but imma just leave this date you are paying for to go watch this guy with a reputation for sexing every girl beat some guy bloody for money, mmkay?? call me!\" (again, not an actual quote)throwing her over his shoulder and forcibly removing her from a party, throwing her in a car, dragging her home, coming very close to taking her virginity (consensually it must tragically be noted) even though she is seeing someone else, but then - is too sensitive even in his drunken lust (mcguire wants you to read it as \"love\") and so all the before with the manhandling and kidnapping is erased/forgiven.forbidding her to leave his house when she asks him to let her out of the terms of the bet. because she has principles, and she can\\'t just welsh on a bet, even if it becomes potentially dangerous and is ruining her relationshipswaiting for her at the front door when she is out on dates, opening it as soon as she arrives to i guess establish dominance and prevent that goodnight kiss?He leaned in, seeming flustered. \"I\\'ll kill him if he touches you.\"\"I like him,\" I said, emphasizing each word.He seemed stunned at my confession and then his features turned severe. \"Fine. If he ends up holding you down in the backseat of a car, don\\'t come crying to me.\"again, because other men are threats to women.beating someone up on abby\\'s tacit commandsaying things like: \"I\\'ll end up in prison if I hear you slept with someone else.\"that whole cafeteria scene where he jumps on the table and sings and everyone joins him in song like he\\'s some hero even though this is the same cafeteria where he unceremoniously dumped a girl from his lap who smart-mouthed america (the character, not the country) and beat a boy severely who smart-mouthed abby. again - deal-breaker for 1) embarrassing and foolish public display and 2) manic episode contrasted with violent episodes a huge red flag for bizarre impulsive behavior.getting a tattoo of abby\\'s name. or the (stupid) nickname he chose for her at first sight. okay, this is hypocritical for me to point out as a warning sign because i have one, and i got it about nine months into the relationship, because he was hurt that i was going to see an ex\\'s show, so on the way to the show, i popped into a place that advertised \"haircuts and tattoos\" and got a tattoo of his name on my marriage-finger, and when i got home and showed it to him, he was understandably freaked out, because who does that? but he was pleased at the gesture. story told to show that: people do stupid things when they are young, and jealousy can be normal and rational and not lead to broken mirrors. and that was 13 years ago, and he still lives with me, so.but i can comment on his other abby-inspired tattoo, which is another deal-breaker for me. the one that says, in hebrew: I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine. leaving aside the fact that he is not jewish, and there is still some jewish cultural discomfort regarding tattoos, it is just another personal bugbear: people who get tattoos in languages not their own and with which they have no personal connection.which view i expressed aloud one time to an ex , forgetting that he had this tattoo: which is the japanese kanji symbol for \"musician\" (or it might just be \"music\" but this is the one i remember him having, so he probably just fucked up, which is why we don\\'t get tattoos of these things in the first place, hmmm??? and - clearly it wasn\\'t a deal-breaker in this case. whatever) which resulted in wounded eyes and me having to do some quick verbal jazz-hands, because i am terribly indelicate and bad at relationships. but still - i think it is dumb. co-opting a culture to be \"cool\" is just the opposite.but enough about \"why i wouldn\\'t date travis\" which is neither here nor there. this book is just bananas, in so many ways. characters are oblivious about their own feelings and the feelings of others. america is inconsistent with her wanting abby to be with travis and her warning her away from him. the poker/mafia subplot is laughable whose only narrative excuse is that it supposedly broadens abby\\'s character and attempts to plant the seed that she isn\\'t as clueless as she appears, and has been using secret ninja poker face this whole time and maybe the prey was the predator all along, and after the reveal, she is suddenly a different person, and travis is in awe of her and suddenly the power is in her hands. but it doesn\\'t wash. it could, but in the hands of a stronger author, one who isn\\'t so prone to inconsistencies. like that one with america. and this one:page 91 - Parker nodded toward the living room and smiled. \"You wanna dance?\"page 134 - abby asks parker to danceHe shook his head. \"Uh… i don\\'t dance.\"but… you just...here are moments of what should be clarity:I closed my eyes. \"We are dysfunctional, Travis. I think you\\'re just obsessed with the thought of owning me more than anything else.\"\"That\\'s not true. I love you more than my life, Pigeon,\" he said, hurt.\"That\\'s exactly what I mean. That\\'s crazy talk.\"\"It\\'s not crazy. It\\'s the truth.\"but then the inevitable backpedal:\"Do you know what co-dependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breathe.“It\\'s dangerous to need someone that much. You\\'re trying to save him and he\\'s hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\" I smiled at the ceiling. \"It doesn\\'t matter what or why it is. When it\\'s good, Kara... it\\'s beautiful.”little moron.and the \"it\\'s okay for me, but not for other people\" attitude.\"Can you believe how ridiculous they are? The girls here are shameless,\" America said.Finch shook his head in awe. \"It\\'s Travis. I think it\\'s the bad-boy thing. They either want to save him or they think they\\'re immune to his wicked ways. I\\'m not sure which.\"\"It\\'s probably both,\" I laughed, giggling at the girls waiting for Travis to pay them attention. \"Can you imagine hoping you\\'re the one he\\'ll pick? Knowing you\\'ll be used for sex?\"\"Daddy issues,\" America said, taking a sip of her drink.but, wait. aren\\'t you….but then, if anyone has daddy issues, it is abby. bizarre, seemingly transplanted from a book with a different plot altogether, daddy issues. now, abby\\'s poor view of all the women travis slept with but then sleeping with him anyway because he has changed and he really loves her etc etc has been called out by a lot of reviewers, and that whole slut-shaming accusation has been made.and i can understand that interpretation of it, but it\\'s not necessarily the same thing as being disgusted with women who are undignified in their pursuit of men. i\\'d be a hypocrite if i judged women who had experienced a rich full sexual life, but there\\'s a difference between the confident woman who chooses her lovers selectively, and the women who stand in line outside a hair-metal tour bus to be systematically and clinically fucked by the bassist. there is an uneven power-dynamic between women who want to fuck fame (even such small-scale fame as travis represents) just for the sake of fame and a story to tell, and that dynamic is different from those girls who are just party girls who like what they like. to me, the: two voluptuous bottle-blondes wearing Sigma Kappa tees where One of them sat on Travis\\' lap, the other sat beside him, pawing at his shirt. are kind of ick, and i don\\'t think it is anti-feminist to think they are ick. because they aren\\'t being portrayed as female characters, they are being used by the author as evidence of travis\\' sexual allure. but again, i have that need for dignity, so - yeah - i judge. but i also judge the judge abby. i judge everyone in this book - they are all horrible people.like in this scene between abby and travis\\' father.which will have to be continued in the comments because, as predicted, i have gone on too long.come to my blog!

BUT NO, HE WANTS TO FUCK HER TOO because like how can he not want too??? you\\'re really fake if you think otherwise. abby is such a hot girl!also,,, screaming/arguing and fighting constantly over the smallest things is just SUCH a healthy relationship to have with your friend. treating them like they\\'re lesser than you is being SUCH A GREAT FRIEND!!!! because that\\'s how she acts with Travis,, like fighting and arguing over the dumbest of shit and i wanted to slam my head against the wall and question who even considered getting this shit published.\"also, if you want to have sex and flirt then you\\'re also a dirty whore and a slut and youre dumb and youre so gross, why do you exist, bye!!!!\" this is pretty much how everyone in this book think about women who want to have sex. if i could count the number of times, abigail or someone else called the many girls in this book a whore/slut for flirting with travis and having sex, i\\'d be a fucking millionaire right now and buying better books than this one. like honestly, i was so disgusted at how badly the women are slut shamed jfc. like, thinking about this book makes me want to throw up and cry about why i even breathe oxygen anymore.if you think Abby is horrible, don\\'t you worry, THERE\\'S SOMEONE WORSE. aka Travis McBitch, the fucking douchiest dickbag of them all. this guy is not hot.he\\'s not. pleasehe\\'s not hot. this guy is a fucking MistakeTM. he\\'s disgusting and equally as annoying as abby. i don\\'t know what the FUCK he saw in Abby McFuckingBitch that was worth getting yelled at and treated like a dogshit. anyways, he\\'s just as worse. first of the firsts, he is scary. he\\'s scary. he\\'s scary. he\\'s fucking scary, extremely controlling and just no. there was this one time where he told abigail to change out of her clothes because they were \"revealing\" hmmmmm how about no, you sausage roll of dicks. women can wear whatever the fuck they want?? fuck off,,, thanks. also, he\\'s really violent??? there was this one scene where he trashed the entire room and broke everything and no one could control him. yikes. he also got borderline psychopathic-ly angry when she was flirting with some guy and decided to date a sweet, nice boy who is not Travis!!! in a scary drunken haze, he opened the car door, in which abby was making out with her bf and pulled her out because he couldn\\'t stand them. he also doesn\\'t let her fucking hang out with any guy and wants to control every aspect of her love life (or just her life in general) aka don\\'t love anyone but me. AKDBSKVBCAL PLEASE JUST STOP. I\\'M SLOWLY LOSING ALL MY BRAIN CELLS AT THIS POINT AND THIS IS ONLY LIKE,,, 50% OF THE BOOK, IMAGINE THE REST.this was so fucking horrible that around the 50% mark i literally started skipping pages and reading two words each page and then just stopped altogether because i care about my health and this book is a horrible fucking disease to it!!!! so like,, fuck this book??? have a nice day.

On one hand, I get it why authors might prefer to go down the self-publishing road. With an industry that gives us Halo and Hades, I\\'d be disheartened too. The thing is, indie writers face a lot of difficulties getting their stuff out there and making a profit, because the general assumption is that self-pubbed books are poorly written, poorly edited things that no agent wanted to take on. So I was very conflicted about reviewing this book. EDIT But not anymore. There\\'s a difference between engaging in discussion and blocking your ears to criticism entirely. I will not, in any way, support an author who allows their fans to attack anyone who disagrees, and then blocks the voices of those who object. Now that I have this out of the way, let\\'s look at \"Beautiful Disaster\". The plot:(view spoiler)[ Abby: I\\'m attracted to a guy who smokes and fights and is basically horrible for me.Travis: I\\'m going to wear you down with my wit and charm and sob story.Abby: Okay, so I like him and he helps me pass my classes, so Ima gonna be FRIENDS with him and totally not take issue with the fact that he had a threesome while I was in the other room. Travis: I\\'m not good enough for her, I\\'m not good enough for her, so I\\'ll let her go on this date with another guy, but then I\\'ll get shitfaced and make a scene. If that doesn\\'t tell her how much I love her, I dunno what will.Drama. Sex. Drama. Drama. Drama. More sex. Abby: So I\\'ll give you a chance, but you gotta change. I don\\'t need more booze and hissy fits from the men in my life.Travis: Fine with me, but you can\\'t leave the house without a coat on because I\\'ll beat the shit out of anyone who looks at you.Abby: You know, I get the feeling that perhaps, maybe this might not have been such a good idea.Drama. Drama. Sex. Drama. Abby\\'s daddy comes along.Daddy: I owe money to a mafioso. Help me out.Abby: Just change my nickname from Pigeon to Doormat. Travis: Hey, this bad guy is offering me a lot of money to fight. So instead of working my ass off towards a relationship, I\\'ll just buy Abby\\'s love. Failproof! Drama. Drama. Drama. Draaaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaaaa. They break up, but now they\\'re at his dad\\'s house and having sex, then she dates this guy again, but then Travis drags her to a fight to stake his claim on her, drama, drama, drama, Abby moves on, Travis beats up someone else, sex, now they\\'re together again, I start skimming pages... Final fight, fire...Abby: You know, even though you tattoo-ed my name on your wrist and I totally freaked out, I think we should totally get married.Travis: Hello, American Airlines? I\\'m calling my girlfriend\\'s bluff, gimme two tickets to Vegas.Abby: I\\'m going to get a \"Mrs. Maddox\" tattoo, because this totally symbolizes my independence and emancipation from my torrid past.The End (hide spoiler)]I think the little tongue-in-cheek take sums it up pretty well, don\\'t you? No? Oh, come on!Look, I have nothing against indie writers. I didn\\'t dislike this book because it was self-pubbed. Sure, there were typos here and there, but we all get those sometimes. Big deal. No, my problem with this book was the plot. Specifically, it was the whole \"bad-boy-that-turns-good\" character typecasting, the doormat heroine, the absolutely insipid ending...I just... I\\'m sorry, Goodreads, but no. Just no. I know nothing original exists in this world, but nothing stops authors from trying to break the mould. Travis is just so painfully archetypal that I feel he was created from a checklist - tattoos, motorbike, dangerous drinking habits, promiscuity, fighting - it\\'s all there, wrapped up in a nice package of douchery. I\\'m so tired of that same old character that I can\\'t even read the story as a \\'guilty pleasure\\'. Retire him or give him a makeover - times are a\\'changing.But wait, you say, surely there are some redeeming qualities about the book. After all, the reason why this archetype exists is because the story connected to it is good. Bad boy narratives are usually about a journey, and redemption through love, right?Yeah, no, this doesn\\'t happen.Oh, sure, Abby shows a remarkable spine for about half the book, but really, there are times when Travis\\' douchery just got to me. And, ultimately, neither of these characters changes - what we\\'re supposed to get from this book was that Abby, no matter how much she wanted to escape her father, really just wanted a younger version of him whom she could bang. Which is very Freudian of her, but not a very pleasant thing to read about. Yes, I know this is a fantasy. Yes, I know this isn\\'t real. But countless girls and women out there are stuck in relationships that are abusive. And to me, Travis\\' behaviour is full of red flags - obsessing over her whereabouts, driving dangerously, dragging her to risky places where he knows she is in danger, but takes her to nevertheless. He goes crazy is she decides to wear a skimpy dress to a dance, forces her to change if he doesn\\'t like how she\\'s dressed, drags her away from a date (with another guy) to take her to a fighting match... need I go on?I\\'m not suggesting that \"Beautiful Disaster\" is trying to teach us something. But I sure as hell don\\'t think a \"Mrs. Maddox\" tattoo is an appropriate ending to this. Sorry, folks.

This book is one of them. I’d be lying if I said that I ever thought this was my sort of book since I’ve made my disdain for the ‘bad boy’ romantic interest known clear many times. However, I do honestly try to go into every book with an open mind. This is the job of a reviewer and it’s what every book deserves, be it traditionally published or otherwise.I loathed this book.Before I even touch upon the abusive relationship in this book (yes, I consider it an abusive one and will detail why later on), I shall discuss other elements of why I so seriously disliked “Beautiful Disaster”. First, there were several spelling and grammar errors which wouldn’t be considered acceptable in traditional publishing so I shall not consider them acceptable here. Why shouldn’t I hold self-published novels to the same standard as traditionally published ones? The writing style itself was fine, although I did wonder if the book started out as fan-fiction or if McGuire got her start in fan-fiction writing. This book reads like it was written chapter-by-chapter in the manner of fan-fiction, with the expected pacing issues that usually accompany this. This also applies to the plotting, which felt predictable, plodding and offered nothing new to the bad boy trope, nor the college romance trope. Character-wise, before I even discuss the breeding pair, I had serious issues. Travis has no respect for women, and almost every other woman in this book, no matter how fleeting their appearance, is described by the narrator Abby in the most derisive terms. Almost every woman Travis encounters wants to have sex with him and acts as seductively as possible when around him, which leads to many of them being called a “slut”, an “STD ridden imbecile”, a “whore”, and so on. They’re also frequently referred to as “bimbos” by Abby, which sets up a sort of virgin/whore complex with Abby and Travis’s former sexual partners. Travis’s promiscuity is mentioned many times but never as derisively as it is when in relation to the women he consensually has sex with. The women in this book seem to exist solely to inflate Travis’s ego and reassert the insulting double standard of “he’s a stud, she’s a slut” (Travis declares that he is a man of standards in that he never sleeps with ugly women. Tell me that’s an attractive trait). The one female character given a modicum of personality and common sense is Kara, Abby’s roommate. She’s the token ‘bitch’ which means she is supposed to be deserving of our scorn or ridicule but she’s the only character to stand up to Abby and tell her Travis is co-dependent and could be dangerous. Abby’s so-called best friends America and Shepley don’t seem particularly concerned with how at risk Abby often is. Granted, there are some scenes where America stands up for her friend, but more often than not she is more likely found to be pushing Abby towards getting together with a noted violent jerk. In fact, America often seems to hold Abby responsible for Travis’s actions. She’s an erratically written character – first telling Abby to stay away from Travis, then pushing her towards him. She ends up serving more as a conflict creating mouthpiece than a real character.Then we come to Travis.If you were ever to create a bad boy checklist, Travis would tick off every box on that list; Troubled upbringing, parent issues, tattoos, extremely sexy, smarmy attitude that others somehow see as charming, motorbike, heavy drinking, no respect for authority, promiscuity, etc. We are supposed to believe that Travis is something of an irresistible enigma. Men secretly admire him, women want to sleep with him, he’s even so charming that he can lead a cafeteria sing-along like a bad boy Zac Efron. He gets straight A’s without having to work for them. He keeps a top class athlete physique and unbeatable fighting skills without having to work out or train in any way. He’s an unoriginal character who only differs from every other bad boy in literature right now by going the full distance in his extreme behaviour. Travis is a disturbed individual in every way. He can’t control his temper, he gets jealous at the slightest of actions, he is prone to smashing up whatever is in sight, and he emotionally manipulates Abby into doing his will, including telling her what to wear, where to go and accompany him to events where she’ll have to act romantically with him. The list goes on. He gives her the nickname “Pigeon” for some ridiculous, badly explained reason, and refers to her as this for the majority of the book instead of by her name. Sometimes these actions are rightfully criticised and Abby shows a remarkable amount of backbone at times in her criticism of Travis, but time and time again she forgives him and time and time again he commits further controlling, manipulative and violent acts. At one point, he punches a man for touching her arm, coming precariously close to punching Abby. Below is a passage from the book, after Abby has had sex with Travis and left without saying goodbye:“Travis is a fucking wreck! He won’t talk to us, he’s trashed the apartment, threw the stereo across the room… Shep can’t talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It’s scaring me! Abby, he’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was… Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door… broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!” This is not okay. This is not normal. It’s certainly not ‘passionate’ or ‘sexy’. I understand that this is supposed to be somewhat messed up. However, there is a complete lack of authorial control over the contents of this book. The choice of a 1st person narrative is part of the problem. Abby, nor any other character in the book, fully explains their motives and she can barely explain why she feels so strongly about Travis, let alone describe why she continues to come back to Travis again and again. Even when she condemns his abhorrent actions, it’s never fully convincing. She stands by and watches him pummel people to the ground on more than one occasion and seemingly accepts it. In fact, the entire book seems to accept his actions as just being part of wacky crazy Travis’s wild life. He’s the stud (never a slut) with a temper and it’s your own fault for pissing him off. I don’t care what people are saying about you, you don’t bash a man’s head in with a lunch tray! Despite doing this – in public! – over and over again, nobody in the college intervenes, the police are never called on him and the possibility of mental health problems, which would be perfectly justified, are never brought up. The author has mentioned how realistic this book is but this particular element is definitely not. No college in America would accept this behaviour, no matter how many A’s that student gets. This book is supposed to be in the vein of the old favourite ‘bad boy and the one girl who changes him’ trope. But that’s the biggest issue here. He doesn’t change. They marry, she gets a “Mrs Maddox” tattoo and this is all seen as okay, but it’s not. Throughout the book he talks about how Abby has changed him or how he needs her with him at all times to help him become a better person, but he remains a violent, rude and ultimately dangerous individual throughout. On top of having absolutely no respect for the many women he has slept with, he never really has any respect for Abby. He makes major decisions that would affect them both without listening to Abby, he stalks her several times and never seems to truly trust her. If he truly trusted her, why would he become so violent when she’s in the presence of other men? Listening to Travis and Abby justify his actions sounded far too much like the justifications of spousal abuse, the broken down words of a beaten wife trying to prove that he’s really a wonderful man who loves her deeply but sometimes he just can’t help himself. By the end of the book, Travis and Abby declare that they are each-others for life but Travis is clearly the one with the power here. Does anyone think he’ll ever really change? Someone I love very dearly is in a situation like this, albeit an emotional one rather than violent one. The difference? He’s a regular looking man, not a tattooed motor-biking bad boy. Not so sexy now, is it? This book may be right up your alley. You may be a fan of the bad boy trope and here it is taken to the most extreme conclusion without resorting to wife battering, although in my opinion a lot of Travis’s behaviour is that of an abusive spouse. If this book is your thing then more power to you. I may not understand why but for some people, the idea of a damaged man being consumed by his obsession for a woman is an ideal fantasy, and I have no right to criticise that fantasy, no matter how unhealthy it may be. This book’s got a lot of fans. I’m not one of them. I despised this book. “Beautiful Disaster” now topples “Hush Hush” and becomes the most disgusting book I have ever read. 0/5 (that one star is too good for this).

Thanks to my mother who recommended me this book, otherwise I never would've picked this book up. I went into this book blind because I heard a lot of mixed reviews about it so I didn't know what to really expect when I read this book. I really really liked it. That's pretty much all I can say. There was nothing I didn't like about it. I like a hero that's possessive and gets jealous because ultimately it means that the hero does actually care about the heroine. I also think Travis is a good example of the perfect bad boy. He fights, he's popular, has tattoos, drives a motorcycle and sleeps around etc. Travis sleeping with other women didn't bother me at all, I know it probably should bother me, but that just makes me more anxious to see how he wins the girl in the end. Abby was a really good heroine, she was very likable and probably one of the few heroine's I actually enjoyed reading the perspective from.

H. O. A!!I am trying my darnedest to come up with a word that would best describe what I just read, because honestly, this book has left me a bit speechless.I’m guessing an apt word would be “intense.” Intense emotions, intense love, intense actions. An intense, toxic relationship! Despite of all his flaws, which he revealed unashamedly, I fell head over heels for the hero, Travis, but the heroine, Abby, well ... she needed someone to knock some pure ever lovin’ sense into her. I mean seriously!!Although this is a romance, it sometimes read like a suspense, as each time I turned a page I kept one eye shut wondering what kind of trouble Travis was going to get himself into next.This was one of the most compelling ‘bad boy falls for the good girl,’ on again/off again romances I have ever read. Just as the title implies their relationship is a beautiful disaster. I pounded the mattress with my fists. “You can’t tell me what to do anymore, Travis. I don’t belong to you.” In the second it took him to turn and face me, his expression had contorted into anger. He stomped toward me, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face. ”WELL, I BELONG TO YOU!” The veins in his neck bulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to even flinch. He looked at my lips, panting, “I belong to you,” he whispered, his anger melting as he realized how close we were. They were so right for each other it was ’beautiful,’ yet so wrong for each other it was a ’disaster.’ Of course, once again, I am deliberately being vague, because the less you know about the storyline, the more you will enjoy it. I will tell you it is a YA/NA read.So buckle up, and enjoy the ride. It is going to be wild, bumpy, and don’t forget, intense!

Perhaps some therapy would have been in order. (hide spoiler)]Review revised to add a warning : You may cringe at the ridiculous amount of nickname usage in the book.Beautiful Disaster is an appropriate name for this book. We\\'re talking seriously messed up people with seriously messed up issues, and a book that could possibly glorify this sort of behavior. This couple should have never gotten together. This couple represents everything that you should run away from in a relationship.Having said that, I found the book to be realistic to a fault. Oh man, someone is going to flame and skewer me for this statement.But, I\\'m going to get real here. Volatile and destructive relationships happen. Maybe not to most people, but there is going to a be a select group of people who read this book and think, \"holy crap...been there.\" And I was one of them. I\\'ve been in this relationship before. Did it work out? Of course not. Hence, my issues with (view spoiler)[the end of this book. (hide spoiler)]Book relationships are often glossed over. Couples come together, and problems are usually just tiny obstacles to the happily ever after. Or...the problems come from a source outside of the couple itself. The world is falling apart, supernatural creatures are invading, etc. The actual problems aren\\'t with the people, but with the hurdles they have to jump before they can be happy.This book dealt with real issues, real drama, and things that do often happen when people become obsessed in a relationship. Should this be romanticized? Probably not. Does it make for an interesting read? I guess it depends on the reader. I like train wrecks, maybe because I\\'ve been inside of them myself in real life. I didn\\'t have my shit together when I was younger, and sometimes it\\'s nice to read about other people who don\\'t always have their shit together. I wish I had been one of these teens in books who seem to have their head on straight, but I was flitting around doing stupid things and hanging out with other people who were doing even stupider things. In that sense, I can relate. Did I grow out of my wicked ways? Haha, I hope so...Abby and Travis are (and pardon my language) fucked up. Nothing about this relationship is healthy. Even knowing that it was all wrong, I was still rooting for something good to come out of this. It just didn\\'t go down in the way that I would have liked to have seen happen. There was opportunity for the author to take a tough story and turn it into something responsible and this just didn\\'t happen. I say this all the time : I do enjoy reading about flawed characters. Mistakes are fine. People are flawed. People screw up. I just need real growth to happen at some point! For me, the resolution didn\\'t show growth so much as it showed hesitant compromises from people who didn\\'t want to lose each other. Again, been there. It\\'s called desperation and fear of losing the other person, so you tentatively make concessions in order to keep them. Again, that\\'s the relationship doomed to fail without some sort of hardcore change or therapy.I feel bad for going back and picking apart a book that I enjoyed reading to start. Train wrecks are pretty damn entertaining. Travis had issues and scared the shit out of me, but his vulnerability and fears reached out to the part of me that wants to comfort hurting people. The responsible side of me says that he\\'s damaged goods and women need to run far, far away. The empathetic side of me wants to just cuddle him. I have a weakness for people who are hurting and in real life, those are the people I would reach out to - the people who want love, but don\\'t know how to make it happen.I\\'d only recommend this book for older teens and up. There was a lot of smoking, drinking, fighting, sex, womanizing, etc. Even though the drama made it feel a little younger, the content was more adult in nature.

I\\'m the last person on the planet to read it, so summarizing the plot just seems a waste of time. Instead, I\\'m going to skip straight to my criticism.First off, if you don\\'t like first person narration, this is not the book that will change your mind. It uses the device particularly poorly. Our narrator, the heroine, at times has too much insight into the minds of others and at other times has too little knowledge of her own mind. None of her personality comes through in the narration. She just describes what she and the people around her did, using a flat, emotionless sort of voice. It was like the story was written in third person then run through a find/replace to switch the pronouns. Abby thinks bizarre things like:I looked down to my plate, letting the long strands of my caramel hair create a curtain between us.and mangles grammar like:Kara was reading ahead in her brand-new books, grimacing at America and I when we walked in.Secondly, I think this early bit of characterization says it all about Travis: He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders. Since tribal tattoo = douchebag, the fact that he\\'s a misogynist asshole didn\\'t surprise me too much:“I don’t promise anyone anything, Pidge. She didn’t stipulate a relationship before she spread eagle on my couch.”I stared at the couch with revulsion. “She’s someone’s daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?”“My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let’s put it that way.”Nice sex negative message there, don\\'t you think? Abby the virgin is a good girl. All of Travis\\' past one night stands are referred to as \"sluts,\" \"bimbos,\" \"whores\" and \"Barbie dolls.\" Abby joins right in with Travis on the slut shaming, making it plain that the sexual double standard isn\\'t just a character flaw of Travis\\', it\\'s an assumption that drives the narrative. Women who enjoy sex are dirty sluts who don\\'t deserve respect in this story\\'s world, and that\\'s some sad internalized misogyny.Next up is how Travis is a textbook abuser archetype. He never hits Abby or any other woman in the book, but he exhibits every quality present in your average domestic abuser. He has a violent temper when he doesn\\'t get his way:“He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! Please tell me!” she pleaded, her eyes glossing over. “It’s scaring me!”The fear in her eyes forced only the partial truth. “I just couldn’t say goodbye. You know it’s hard for me.”“It’s something else, Abby. He’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was…Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that.“He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door…broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!”He\\'s possessive, even after Abby\\'s broken up with him:“I love you. I can’t let other guys dance with you.”He\\'s quick to violence when he feels he\\'s been insulted:Travis lifted Finch’s tray off the table and swung it into Chris’ face, knocking him off his chair. Chris tried to scramble under the table, but Travis pulled him out by his legs, and then began to wail on him.Chris curled into a ball, and then Travis kicked him in the back. Chris arched and turned, holding his hands out, allowing Travis to land several punches to his face. The blood began to flow, and Travis stood up, winded.And, most importantly, he sees nothing wrong with his behavior. I\\'m not a sheltered delicate flower. I\\'m a hockey fan who has been in her fair share of scraps over the years. I don\\'t think a violent temper necessarily makes someone a predator. What makes Travis a predator, to my mind, is how his violent attacks on people outside the fight ring aren\\'t treated as a personality flaw. These actions are not only not condemned by the characters or narrative, they\\'re actually held up as examples of his love for and devotion to Abby. Viciously bloodying an innocent bystander\\'s nose is treated as a heroic act. All that said, had this book ended at its halfway point, I think I would have begrudgingly given it 4* for being a cracktastic trip back to college to stroll down Bad Life Decisions Lane. It encapsulated the self-centered, impulsive, emotional and dramatic whirlwind that is young adulthood in a way adult contemporary romance does not. I know, as someone who graduated from college more than a decade ago, that Travis is bad news and that Abby\\'s a head case, but college is the time for bad behavior. I would\\'ve liked an indication from the narrative that they were all screwed up and/or getting away with something, but it was seductive to go back to a time where you didn\\'t know any better and you felt free to take crazy risks.Unfortunately, the author seems to have been unable to part with her characters and spent the second half writing her own fan fiction where Abby and Travis have Adventures! and break up and make up along the way. There\\'s a beyond bizarre trip to Vegas that comes out of fucking nowhere. Abby\\'s father is pointlessly introduced and forgotten about in an abrupt fashion. There\\'s a throwaway sub-plot involving a mobster and a brush with death just to seal the deal. Where the first half of the book follows a nice dramatic arc, the second half is a half-witted sine wave shamelessly stalling the HEA. Bleh.In the end, the gratuitous violence, misogyny, poor writing and uneven pacing team up to make this a sub par read for me. I\\'m not going to wring my hands over the terrible message this sends to YA readers, because I don\\'t think fiction works on people like that, but neither can I enjoy something with such glaring negative themes in it. McGuire has a knack for telling a story, but I can\\'t ignore the flaws in this to enjoy it. 2* ', 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/197139055?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1)', 'Navessa', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa', 'Mar 06, 2013', 'did not like it', '1380', ' *Trigger Warning: This review contains strong themes, to include rape.*Before I begin what will likely become a very long rant/public service announcement, let me first say a few words. I have nothing against E.L. James. Nothing. She’s said that this series is a fantasy she managed to put on paper and that she never expected it to gain such momentum. Good for her for perusing her dream of writing. If this book also fulfills one of your fantasies, or if you just plain enjoyed it, good for you too. This review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books, and nor is it an attack on the author. These are solely MY OPINIONS about how dangerous FSoG is to society and specifically to women. Needless to say, this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies. It’s pretty much my biggest nightmare.“But it’s just fiction!”No. You can’t use that argument with me. Not anymore. This book is not “just fiction”. This book has become a frigging phenomenon. As I write this, over 70 million copies have been sold in the United States alone, hardware stores have run out of “natural fiber” rope and there are even ‘BDSM for Beginners’ classes cropping up in small town America.So excuse me, but I can’t just read this and think of it like a fantasy, not when it’s become a reality for so many people, and not when I was so enraged by what I found within it.Okay everyone, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in. We’re going to be here for a while. First up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements I’m going to make, so we might as well rip the band aid off.THIS BOOK PERPETUATES THE RAPE CULTURE WE WERE ALL RAISED IN.There, I’ve said it. I’m not taking it back and I’m not apologizing. If you’re unfamiliar with this phrase, allow me to elaborate. Wikipedia defines rape culture as:“A term used within women\\'s studies and feminism, describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.”Let’s look at the first half of that definition. As much as we may want to ignore the facts, rape and sexual violence are common in America. According to RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. On average that’s about 207,754 sexual assaults each year. 54% of sexual assaults are not reported, 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim.I could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes, practices, and the media condone sexual violence, but I won’t because I’m really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to FSoG. Thankfully, throughout my research, I found several…hundred.The University of California has an interesting article about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture. In it, they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors. Here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on:1. When spoken to, a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile.2. Women must answer questions asked of them.3. Women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable.4. When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men.5. Casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman’s desirability.6. It is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations.7. When engaged in a social encounter, it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game, sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted.8. Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help.There’s a blog post by Harriet Jacobs that also speaks to this and I urge you to read it in its entirety. In short, it says “…women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that:· it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (“mean bitch”)· it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (“crazy bitch”)· it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (“stuck-up bitch”)· it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (“angry bitch”)· it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (“bitch got daddy issues”)· it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (“dyke bitch”)· it is not okay to raise your voice (“shrill bitch”)· it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (“mean dyke/frigid bitch”)Now how do these two examples relate to FSoG? Simply put, Ana, the main character in this series, continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets. She might as well be the case study on which both were based.Early in the book there’s an interaction between her and a young man named Paul, the son of the couple she works for. This is someone she says has “always been a buddy”. Just after they greet each other with a hug, “he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle from foot to foot, embarrassed. It’s good to see Paul, but he’s always been overly familiar”Does she tell him that she’s uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm? No, that’d be going against everything that rule number three has taught her. Plus, she wouldn’t want to come across as a “mean bitch” now would she? Just after this, Paul asks her out. “Whenever he’s home he asks me on a date, and I always say no. It’s a ritual.” Is it a ritual? Or is it something more than that? Has Ana, like many of us, been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn’t know how to tell him “It’s not okay to keep asking me out”? Is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she’ll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely? Or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn’t been taught to?When she turns him down, yet again, he goes on to say “Ana, one of these days you’ll say yes.” Creeped out yet? You should be. How does Ana respond to this declaration? By escaping the room they’re in and getting back to a crowded store floor. What does this tell us? She felt the need to flee. She felt the need to not be alone with him. Part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her “friend”. But instead of speaking up, she fled.She never voices her discomfort. She is the submissive, quiet person that society has taught her to be. And 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced, yet again, through her actions, behaviors and words (or lack thereof).How will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault? I can tell you, because just a few chapters later, she’s sexually assaulted, by another of her “friends”.“José, I’m okay. I’ve got this.” I try to push him away rather feebly. “Ana, please,” he whispers, and now he’s holding me in his arms, pulling me close.“José, what are you doing?”“You know I like you Ana, please.” He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck…he’s going to kiss me.“No, José, stop – no.” I push him, but he’s a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him. His hand has slipped into my hair, and he’s holding my head in place. “Please, Ana, carińo,” he whispers against my lips… He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. The feeling is suffocating.“José, no,” I plead. I don’t want this.Luckily, Ana is spared further abuse because the one and only Christian Grey arrives on the scene and saves her. How? By saying “I think the lady said no.” That’s right. Ana can try to push José away and tell him ‘no’ multiple times but that’s not good enough. One sentence from a man and José immediately releases her, bringing us back to rule number four: When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. You got that, ladies? Don’t try to fight back because you’ll just be ignored, rely instead on a man. Sort of a catch 22 when the one who’s going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man.Bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar, just a shout away from salvation. You’re probably wondering why Ana didn’t scream. Why she didn’t fight harder. Well, I’d like to bring up Harriet Jacob’s blog post again because just after her “bitch list” she says this:“If we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways.And we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes.Women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout “NO” at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close.Women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying “NO.”Women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted, are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself, are not going to know how to argue with “but you liked kissing, I just thought…”Women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting, kicking, and screaming until it’s too late, if they do at all…Nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation. Women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social, professional, and sexual interactions.”Eerie, isn’t it? I sure thought so. Hopefully by now you’re beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with.Not only do Ana’s actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that I mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture, like victim silencing. For instance, once she’s collected herself, this happens:“Turning, I glance at José, who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey, CEO. Ana, who are you kidding? He’s just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. There’s no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior.”That’s right folks. It isn’t ladylike to yell (shrill bitch). It isn’t ladylike to swear (crazy bitch). It isn’t ladylike to defend yourself after you’ve just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch). Leave that to the menfolk. Surely they’ll defend you. Surely they’ll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted. Men, you know, the other sex, the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions. In public.And while we’re discussing this scene we can’t forget about rule number eight: Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. That’s what Christian is to her at this point in the book. A stranger. She’s seen him only three times, in formal or work-related settings, and knows nothing about him other than he’s rich, good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (I’ll get to that last part later in the review). But accept his help and trust his kindness she does. She lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar, assuming that as he’s just saved her from a sexual assault, he\\'s not planning one of his own.When she wakes up in his suite the next morning, pantsless by the way, she accuses Christian of stalking her. He defends himself by saying:“…if I hadn’t come to get you, you’d probably waking up in the photographer’s (José’s) bed, and from what I can remember, you weren’t overly enthused about him pressing his suit,” he (Christian) says acidly. Pressing his suit! I glance up at Christian. He’s glaring at me, eyes blazing, aggrieved. I try to bit my lip, but I fail to repress my giggle.“Which Medieval chronicle did you escape from? You sound like a courtly knight.”You got that? Stalking’s okay. Because it’s better than being raped.*facepalm*I’m almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing. How little she’s concerned with her “friend’s” behavior is appalling. That there’s no thought on her end about Christian’s allusion to her rape escape is appalling. How she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling. It continues by the way.“I would have been fine. I was with Kate.”“And the photographer?” he (Christian) snaps at me.“José just got out of line.” I shrug.A shrug is a dismissive gesture, just in case you were wondering. She dismisses sexual assault as ‘getting out of line’. She downplays the severity of what happened. Why does she do this? Because it’s awkward to talk about it? Because it’s scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said ‘no’ he ignored her? Guess what? It’s always going to suck to talk about. It’s always scary to realize that statistics say that if you’re raped, you’ll know your attacker. But we need to talk about these things because if we don’t, nothing will ever change.And now the grand finale, victim shaming and blaming. You see, José feels bad for what he did. At first, Ana is pissed at him, as she should be, and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages, she continues to ignore him, deciding to “let him stew”. Then the NEXT DAY, this happens:\"The memory of José’s attempted kiss haunts me. I’m beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back.\"She feels cruel? She feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her? Well, of course she does. She\\'s been trained to be gracious and polite. He\\'s addressing her. Rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so. Two days later, they talk:“Can I see you? I’m sorry about Friday night. I was drunk…and you…well. Ana – please forgive me.”“Of course, I forgive you José. Just don’t do it again. You know I don’t feel like that about you.”Here’s where I start to get really angry. “..and you…” what exactly? Were there? Were breathing? Had tits? How can José’s behavior in any way be blamed on Ana? This is the “she deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt” mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds. No one can ever make you do anything. Everything you do, every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make. So no, there is no “…and you…”.Books like this, with scenes like the ones I’ve spoken about only perpetuate our silence, our ignorance, our discomfort, and our complicity. They reinforce unhealthy behaviors and thinking patterns and they perpetuate rape culture. Authors, I beg you, don’t cover tough issues and strong themes if you can’t do them justice. Grant them the depth and the severity they deserve.

I was thinking that I might not ever personally read a book worthy of one star, and I was messing up my scale by giving some of the more lame books I've read lately two stars instead of one.Thank you E.L. James, for proving to me there was something worth waiting for. Something that truly exemplifies the meaning of terrible.Now hold up, all you would-be defenders. I read this whole thing. I did not skip anything, I did not skim, I read every word. I bought this book with the intention of giving it the benefit of the doubt. You see, I love erotica, and I'm not ashamed to say that I both read (as you see on my 2012 books I've already read two others) and write it myself. So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there's a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with.NO.NO.NO.NO.This book is NOT:- erotic/sexy- funny, even ironically- endearing- full of sexual taboosThis book IS:- repetitive- plotless (well, you knew that)- painful to get through- depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable- how to not write a novel- how to gain success by using other people's characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bankMost people know about the twilight matchups so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details:Bella Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in Arizona Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to Forks Vancouver, Washington where her dad stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in Florida Georgia. She has a younger friend named Jacob Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and police force army buddies, and who gave her his old truck VW beetle.Edward Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named Emmett Elliott and a sister named Alice Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents Carlisle Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn't even change the first three letters?) and Esme Grace. Their father mother is a doctor. Rose Kate and Jasper Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens.Also, he 'dazzles' her.I can't even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn't change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it 'different' enough to publish as is. It's quite disgusting.Alright, continuing on, and once again, I'm sure you've heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him. Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there's the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she's not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that's all into the sex. It's strange because I'm also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it's written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It's funny because she's supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. This is sense. Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24:“Through the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.”What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry?Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest:Through the haze of light, I squint and see ,Christian leaning over me, Smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.That's almost better.Let's have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more:“I didn't put that song on my iPod,” he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway.What? He knows what he's doing, the bastard. Who did? And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. Who...who?The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. Who? Who? I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who?SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU.Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing's worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it's based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and naïve. I didn't realize. I'm sorry. You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You're like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. I can't even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book.And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I'm going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly:Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main charactersInciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the storyPlot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etcMidpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it's a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinkingPlot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflictClimax: final showdown or decisions needed to be madeResolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or anotherBasically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you'll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn't wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there's enough substance there. And since that's a lot of vagueness, we'll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney's Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict:Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one.And the seven sentence story: Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn't want to be stuck in a mundane life.Inciting Incident: Belle's father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle.Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle.Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent.Plot Point 2: Belle's father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he's giving up his chances of being with her.Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast.Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. Okay, so let's try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.)Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU.Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he's hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry.Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he's into S&M. Also they have sex.Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. Plot Point 2: Nah, she's still deciding and whining about how he's kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2.Climax: Well there isn't really one, it's just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess...Resolution: She says he's too weird and ends it. What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you've gotten this far, nope.But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn't really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that's how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can't wait to see them get back together and whine some more.And let's talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you'll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it's pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he's taking it easier on her since she's inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn't sound fun.And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that's not even a surprise (although imo it's not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn't going to be a mess in the morning.Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things:-I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. “I'm gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.” ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don't get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I fired up my email.” BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED.-They actually do the “you hang up” “no you hang up” “no you” that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross.-Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn't 'experienced enough to understand,' lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It's not what he's doing, it's how he's doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it's for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the naïve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help.-He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I'm joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she's at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She's supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can't stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn't seen in 6 months. I can't at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can't stay away.It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I've hated about past relationships I've had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book? How does anyone think that this is sexy, that this depicts something they want?I can't even.I cannot.(Also I should never have imagined Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl as the main characters. Now everytime I see a commercial for Gossip Girl, rage courses through my body.)I'm bored. Someone get me out of here.P.S. Did you know that James recently stated she's set the bar for writing pretty high?Cool.Please, do yourself a favor and go buy a book of much higher quality plot and writing, ohhhh like....Modelland. \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/315616160?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1)', 'Katrina Passick Lumsden', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden', 'Jun 02, 2012', 'did not like it', '19410', ' What in the hell just happened? Did I really read that? Oh, my god, I did. I did read that. Meet Anastasia Steele: Ana is just a giant mess of a human being. She\\'s insecure to the point of it being laughable, \\'klutzy\\' (even though she only trips twice in the entire book), and a complete ditz. She\\'s a virgin (of course) who\\'s never taken any sexual interest in anyone before. Right. I\\'m fairly certain there hasn\\'t been a woman this naive since \\'round about 1954. At one point, she thinks putting her hair in pigtails will keep her safe from Christian\\'s lusty advances. Fuckin\\' really? She \"flushes\" constantly, and on several occasions referred to her hoo-hoo-naughty place as \"down there.\" Next, we have Christian Grey: Christian is a misogynistic, self-loathing, abusive piece of shit. Apparently, his only redeeming qualities are, in this order; his ridiculous good looks, his money, and his giant penis. The only time Ana seems to like him as a person is when he\\'s being \"lovable\", and those times are few and far between. Most of the time he\\'s serious, brooding, and threatening. How charming.I knew from the very first line this wasn\\'t going to be good. \"I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.\" It was cemented that early, my deep, deep dislike for this moronic, simpering asshole. Your hair won\\'t behave? Guess what? My suspicions were confirmed a few pages later when Ana admits that any \"sympathy\" she feels for her sick friend is \"unwelcome\". Unwelcome, apparently because her friend is beautiful, even when she has the flu...? What a petty, jealous cunt. The only thing that made the first 4% of this book tolerable was the fact that I read it aloud to my younger brother, and his frequent commentary was amusingly distracting. Once he gave up, however, I had to travel the rest of the road alone. What a painful journey it was. My first impressions of Ana were bad (deservedly so). What were my first impressions of Christian? Well... That\\'s how I felt about Christian Grey. From the beginning. Any time an author tries to sell me on a character\\'s \"charm\" by waxing hormonal about how \"ridiculously good-looking\" he is, I snicker inwardly. I can\\'t think why.... Huh.Anyway, after reading about the description of Christian\\'s building (hello, first penis metaphor), I had to sit through the awful dialogue between these smarmy idiots and hope beyond hope that something, anything, would distract me enough to see me through to the end. Turns out, I found something about 15% through. I went back and counted, and kept track throughout the rest of the book, and do you have any idea how many fucking times Ana said \"Oh my\" in this monumentally bad missive? Do you? I\\'ll tell you; 79! 79 motherfucking times. \"He pulled me back against his chest...oh my.\" \"He began kissing a trail down my belly, oh my.\" \"He\\'s an insufferable douchenozzle, oh my!\" (I\\'m just thankful that neither lions, tigers, nor bears were brought into this mess at any point.) About halfway through, I wished I\\'d been keeping track of the word \"crap\" because Ana is constantly saying/thinking it. Crap, Holy Crap, Double and Triple Crap, Oh Crap, This Crap, That Crap, any and all Crap. Speaking of crap, if I ever, ever ever have to hear/read the words \"inner goddess\" again, I\\'m going to construct a pyre out of tampons and maxi pads, light it, and toss unsuspecting women into it. ^My inner goddess will cap yours in the face if you don\\'t shut the fuck up^I\\'m sorry, I just couldn\\'t take any of this seriously. His playroom. His playroom? Really? Or how about his weird-ass issues with food? He wants the girl slim and in shape, yet he won\\'t stop trying to force her to eat! I simply love the attempt E.L. James made at giving these pathetic shells personalities. Ana wears Converse, drives a vintage car, and likes classic British lit. *Yawn* haven\\'t heard any of that before. And Christian; we know Christian\\'s super deep and sophisticated because he plays the piano and listens to obscure classical music. This is how we know Edward Christian is really just a lost soul in need of love; his love of music. Everyone knows that no one threatening listens to music. Music lovers just aren\\'t capable of doing anything bad. ^Surprise! Psychos like music, too.^Since this is considered nothing more than \"mommy porn\", I will attempt to pander to that particular demographic for a moment. Were the sex scenes well-written? Well, none of it was particularly well-written. The sex scenes could be kind of...honestly, they were kind of boring. I\\'ve had more exciting sex myself, so I guess reader response to the sex scenes is dependent on reader experience. There\\'s nothing revolutionary here, and a lot of it is just plain unrealistic. I mean, come on, he pretty much jackhammers her hymen and she walks away with nothing more than a passing, pleasant soreness? Riiiight. How about the time he gives her a handjob with a soapy washcloth? Hello? Apparently neither one of them has ever heard of a urinary tract infection. Oh, or we could talk about her first time giving Christian a blowjob, during which Ana established herself as some kind of Queen of Deepthroat. Anyone wanna hear about the tampon scene? Oh, you\\'ve already heard about the tampon scene? Yeah, same here, although hearing about it and reading the actual scene are a bit different. For some reason, you imagine it being worse than it actually is, while at the same time, reading about it is more horrifying than you could possibly imagine. \"He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string...what! And...gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet.\" Look, I\\'m not against sex during menses, but a guy plucking out a girl\\'s tampon? Yeah, gross. I\\'m not a prude, but there are certain lines people just shouldn\\'t cross. What makes it worse is that Christian is just thrilled that Ana\\'s raggin\\' because he hates using condoms. Apparently, Mr. GinormoDick doesn\\'t know that a woman can get pregnant while on her period. Which is hilarious considering all the teaching and training he\\'s doing to remedy Ana\\'s sexual ignorance. Sexual dependence, thy name is Anastasia Steele. We\\'re supposed to believe that this girl has gone 21 years neither having had sex nor masturbating? Hm. Well, Christian\\'s supposed sexual prowess makes a bit more sense now, as does Ana\\'s assertion that he has a giant bologna wand. She has absolutely zero experience, and she\\'s never once had anything \"in there\". Thing could be the size of a baby carrot and she\\'d still be like, \"Oh, my glob! How is it ever going to fit?!\" It\\'s good that she stockpiled all those potential orgasms, though, because now she\\'s capable of having like, 15 a day or something. It\\'s ridiculous. Come to think of it, Christian\\'s obsession with her eating habits makes a bit more sense now. She was probably beginning to look like something out of a horror movie. Seriously, though, are we going to take the word of a girl who is apparently so undersexed she\\'s never even masturbated? I guess I can sort of understand this obsession with some kind of an awakening, but...really? \"Oh, he\\'s soooo good in bed!\" How the hell would she know?! She has absolutely nothing with which to compare, not even her own damn hand! Now I\\'ll be totally honest, the biggest issue I have with Fifty Shades of Shit is neither the sex nor the horrible writing. It\\'s the plot. Thin as it is, it\\'s still there, its core message being that, given enough time, you can change someone. While I don\\'t have any problem with this if all you\\'re trying to do is help them to lose weight or quit smoking, when you\\'re talking about an emotionally and (dangerously close to) physically abusive relationship, sending that kind of message is ridiculous and irresponsible. Christian is controlling, possessive, condescending, and cruel. He doesn\\'t allow Ana to behave as she normally would, and Ana just puts up with it, insistent that if she can give him what he wants, when he wants, as often as he wants, she can eventually begin to pull his strings. Will it work? In the books, probably. In real life? No. Almost never. How many misguided women are going to waste their lives on some emotionally retarded prick because they\\'ve read shit like this and think this kind of fucked-up fairytale will come true for them? I\\'ve known women with this mentality. \"Oh, he\\'s so dark and dangerous and threatening, but he\\'s got a sad, lonely side, and if I could just figure out what\\'s wrong, I could change him!\" Wake the fuck up! He may be hot, he may have a huge dick, he may even be rich, that doesn\\'t make him a good person. It doesn\\'t even make him a potentially good person. Quit.Being.A.Fucking.Idiot. (Look, I can make my words Staccato like Christian. Now hold still while I choke you until you pass out...) ^Ana and Christian^ - \"I said don\\'t roll your eyes at me!!\"Christian stalks Ana (which she turns into a fucking joke), and whispers things to her \"threateningly\". She\\'s constantly afraid he\\'s going to beat the crap out of her, and with good reason as he, on more than one occasion, tells her he\\'s going to/wants to.Potential rape is downplayed. Ana\\'s friend, Jake Jose, starts pushing himself on her rather vehemently when they\\'re both drunk. Ana repeatedly says no, but Jose just keeps trying to go in for the kill. Admiral Chaps busts on up with his riding crop, however, and saves her. Ana (understandably) avoids Jose for a while after that, and when her other friend asks her why, all Ana says is, \"He made a pass at me.\" Later on, she and Jose are friends again, the \"attempted kiss\" forgotten. *Sigh*Rapists appear to be a theme. Christian tells Ana that he gets off on having complete and total control over another person. This is not just in the bedroom, but in Ana\\'s overall life. On several occasions, he fails to yield when Ana says no, plunging on regardless, assured she\\'ll like whatever he does, anyway, so why bother stopping? And there are women out there who think this is romantic. I wish you the best of luck, ladies. Just keep in mind that while you\\'re fantasizing about abusive, misogynistic assholes like Grey, there are a lot of women dealing with the horrors of actually living with men like him. For all you ladies bustin\\' out your toys while daydreaming about Hunky Mr. Grey, I want you to do something for me. It\\'ll only take a moment. Close your eyes. Think about all the things Christian Grey does in the book. Not just those supposed sweet things, but really, everything. His condescension, his control, his insane jealousy, his threats.....and now....imagine he looks like this: Still turned on? The end of the book was absolutely hilarious, with Ana fleeing in emotional tumult because Christian can\\'t give her what she needs (love! *sniff*). And we\\'re treated to her alternately being angry about the pain and humiliation she faced at Christian\\'s hands, and chastising herself for being a failure and for being mean to Christian. It really is classic abuse mentality. Yet I see her being touted by some as \"strong and independent\". It\\'s this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I\\'ve ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled (outside of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It\\'s a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn\\'t even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It\\'s about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is \\'like, the best thing ever, OMG\\'. It\\'s trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that this is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does good men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice. *Sigh*A bestseller. They\\'re thinking of turning it into a movie....I can\\'t....

Now with whips and chains! Fifty Shades of Shit Haters, please exit stage left.I\\'m not sure what possessed me to pick up Fifty Shades of Grey. I thought I might genuinely like it before I started, but all I was left with was one hell of a mindfuck. Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series.Recently I discovered one of my favorite publishers, Random House, has picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and made this statement:\"An orig\\xadi\\xadnal work, and said to us that James had war\\xadranted the books were, indeed orig\\xadi\\xadnal. Mes\\xadsitte added she was “aware of the nar\\xadra\\xadtive that [50 SHADES] started as dif\\xadfer\\xadently titled piece of fic\\xadtion, but that they were and are two dis\\xadtinctly sep\\xada\\xadrate pieces of work.\"I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m going to have to call bull shit on that. Fifty Shades of Grey and Master of the Universe (the original fan fic) are essentially the same thing. The biggest difference being Edward and Bella\\'s name being replaced with Christian and Anastasia respectively. And I would know this because I have both and while I was reading, I would occasionally switch back and forth between the two without difficulty. I\\'d go through and give you examples myself, but other people have done it already here and here. So if you must read this book, do yourself a solid and find the fan fic online. You even get the second book too!I know some people claim this has no similarities to Twilight and got dammit, I\\'m allergic to all the bull shit. Do I really need to point this all out? Because it looks pretty obvious to me. The mannerisms of the characters are exactly the same. They even say similar things the original characters say. The whole \"dazzle\" line and Edward asking Bella to trust him. Her mother being remarried with the same inability to maneuver her way around a kitchen. Bella is still trying to save Edward from himself due to his troubled past. Edward still stalks and controls Bella, only now he gets to hit her when she gets out of line.*facepalm* Shall I beat them both? Yes?I struggled to come up with a proper review for this book and couldn\\'t figure out why I was feeling rather uninspired to write one. And then I figured it out. I was left so disgusted by this book that I wanted to purge the memory of its existence from my mind. With a rusty nail. Every time I thought of the book my brain cells would go on strike, yelling obscenities at me. Anyway, I thought Bella and Edward\\'s relationship couldn\\'t get anymore fucked up than Twilight. I stand corrected. If I were to describe FSoG in one sentence it would be this: Fifty Shades of Grey is like Twilight on steroids, high on ecstasy, in a dirty little corner. A very dirty corner. With badly written sex. Lots.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of the beautiful (but of course she doesn\\'t know it), naive virgin, Anastasia Steal after she is suckered into interviewing the Greek god, Christian Grey. Of course, sparks fly and for some unknown reason he can\\'t seem to stay away from this incredibly, unremarkable girl. Ana discovers Christian is into BDSM and desires her as his submissive fuck buddy.There are a myriad of problems with this novel, many of which ironically can be found in Twilight. Never saw that one coming! Christian/Edward is still a controlling bastard, only now he hides behind his BDSM practices to camouflage his abusive tendencies. However, Ana doesn\\'t see it that way. She thinks of him as a broken person and it\\'s her duty to fix him. Even when he says things like this:\"I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn\\'t take.\"Can you believe she let\\'s him beat her after that? And please don\\'t even bother to tell me that it\\'s just BDSM. No, just fucking no. Ana is genuinely afraid of Christian and is never entirely comfortable with the \"punishment\" aspect of their relationship. But Christian just manipulates her with sex to continue the relationship. And that\\'s what really gets me. I just have a hard time believing a virgin would somehow become a sex goddess overnight, because that is exactly what happens. When she first is introduced to his kinky lifestyle and tells him she is a virgin he immediately tells her he needs to handle that \"situation\" before they could continue. What?! Since when is your virginity a \"situation?\" But, that\\'s not really the kicker. Oh, no, because that is when we are introduced to Ana\\'s two best friends. Everyone say hi to: Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Anna\\'s inner goddess, who always cheers her on when Christian wants sex or wants to punish her. She\\'s also quite annoying, doing back flips at the mention of anything sexual related. Simmer down. Where did she come from exactly? Ana is in her twenties and has never felt the urge to have sex with anyone until Christian comes along with his whips and chains?!And... Ana\\'s sub-conscious, who hides behind couches when it comes time for her beating. When it comes to Ana having sex with Christian, well, her sub-conscious only has one thing to say, So after the \"situation\" is handled, Ana has to sign a \"contract\" agreeing to his sexual demands and also outlining things she won\\'t do. It was pretty pointless considering he still got what he wanted and she never signed the damn thing. He exploits her, stalks her and abuses her! She cries after sex. She is afraid of him being angry! Even when he is angry at something else, she thinks it\\'s her. Her reasoning for allowing him to hit her as his therapy is because she\\'s afraid to lose him. That is not a reason for agreeing to a BDSM lifestyle! In fact, that\\'s not even really \"consent!\" These quotes just scream domestic abuse to me:\"Please don\\'t be angry with me,\" I whisper.\"Please don\\'t hit me,\" I whisper, pleading.His brow furrows, his eyes widening. He blinks twice.\"I don\\'t want you to spank me. Not here. Not now. Please don\\'t.\"Yeah, he\\'s a real catch, that one. Barf. No, excuse me. That\\'s not right. The barfing came when the little ass-wipe PULLED HER TAMPON OUT AND RAMMED HIMSELF INSIDE OF HER. OMFG. Yes, the caps were totally necessary because that was the most disgusting thing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. That is not sexy, that\\'s foul.Whenever Ana thinks about leaving him, he comes over to her apartment unannounced pounds into her (literally) and her inner goddess does a fucking happy dance, forgetting her urge to kick his sick ass to the curb. They fight, they breakup. They kiss, they sex up.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Christian: \"Do you still want me gone Ana?\"Inner goddess: *growl*Sub-conscious: ... Dance, puppet. Dance.The writing is a shitty mess too. I mean, if I had to sit and read Ana saying \"Holy, shit!\" or \"Holy, Fuck!\" or \"Oh, my!\" one more time, I was going to lose it. I wanted to take my red pen and have at this \"book\" so badly. It was the little things like Ana\\'s roommate saying over and over, \"You never cry Ana,\" and what do we find Ana always doing? Crying. I\\'m not sure where the hell the plot was. *smacks forehead* How silly of me! Didn\\'t I mention this was a Twilight retelling? Why was I expecting a plot? And another example of poor writing: for these characters to be American, they sounded very British to me. They used phrases that Americans don\\'t use.And now I\\'m trying to figure out why this book is so popular. Why do so many women love this book? I get the appeal of the bondage even though it\\'s not my usual cup of tea. Whips? Chains? Sounds exciting!Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex... Abuse? Not so much.Fuck my life! Zero stars!Eh, I\\'m off to read a good book now and possibly to bleach my brain.More reviews at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.

I honestly do NOT feel like revisiting this book and writing a review. I’d rather spend the time searching for ways to remove this utter nonsense from my memory. However, this book is so bad that I feel the need to warn others from this drivel. Luckily, I did not buy this garbage. I do not even know what overcame me to read it and I can only blame a momentary lack of judgment on my part.What baffles me is the scary fangirlgasm following this book. So what’s causing it a hit? I can only come up with ‘twilight’. Doing some research, this book was originally posted online as a twilight fanfic! Yes, a twilight fanfic. The fact that this book’s source material isn’t a good piece of literature just shows what you should expect from this book. And dubbing it a twilight fanfic and promoting it as such is no doubt raising the bar on the sale figures. What has the world come to? *headdesk* Whatever’s causing its success; I can safely say it can’t be the book itself.Everything you could possibly imagine is wrong with this book! The execution and the characters. And the writing. And the plot (wait, was there one?!?)Firstly, it has been said a countless number of times how abusive Bella and Edward’s relationship was. And it is arguably the most anti-feminist portrayal of any relationship. FSoG simply continues this unhealthy view and promotes an even more abusive and degrading relationship towards women, targeting older women (and possibly even teenage girls who know no better). Oh dear god, I hope teenage girls do not jump on this disturbing bandwagon. Surely, it is degrading to ask a woman to sign a contract where ‘she is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases’ and ‘submitting [herself] to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant…without hesitation or argument’ – especially when you take into consideration the fact that she would be signing up to something she has not yet experienced and knows little about as she is still a virgin. This is not something that should be promoted as desirable or idealistic. This book cheapens what feminists have fought for years! Don’t get me wrong I wouldn\\'t deprive women of their right to express themselves sexually, nor to act upon their desires but I shudder at the thought of women aspiring to a relationship where she will take part in various things that she is not comfortable with and at times, even when she’s genuinely in fear of taking part, simply because she finds the guy ‘hot’.The plot - I’m not even sure if there was one. 50% of the book is spent talking about sex/the contract and the other 50% is made up of clumsily written sex scenes. (view spoiler)[FSoG starts of with Anastasia Steele agreeing to interview the billionaire, Christian Grey. Miss Steele is instantly captivated by Mr Grey’s dashing looks and within 2 days she falls in love with him. Mr Grey for some unfathomable reason can’t keep away from her and reveals to her his secret kinky lifestyle. The two spend the rest of the romantic evening calmly discussing the contract that allows him to fuck her senseless. She reveals to him that she’s a virgin and his only response, he needs to handle that ‘situation’. Really?!? The next 4 days, he gets to do exactly what he wants, he stalks her, abuses her and punishes her by spanking her several times. Quotes that spring to mind – “Please don’t hit me…don’t be angry with me…don’t want you to spank me” Aww, isn’t that romantic? Atleast, she finally sees some sense and walks out. (hide spoiler)]The writing is dull and unimaginative. It reads more like a diary – he did this, I did this. The constant repetitions are enough to make someone suicidal! I hope I never have to see the words, ‘my subconscious’ and ‘my inner goddess’ ever again or so help me god! The sex scenes were terrible and frankly a little disturbing to put down on paper – an incident with the tampon springs to mind.The characters are simply absurd in this book. AnaBella SteeleSwan Anastasia Steele irked me quite a lot and reading this book from her point of view was no picnic in the park. Finding out that she is 21 years old was a shock – she reads like a dim-witted 12 year old, who’s vocabulary doesn’t extend further from ‘jeez’, ‘oh crap’, ‘damn’, ‘oh my’, ‘holy cow’ and even the constant reference to her vagina as ‘down there’. I found nothing remotely interesting about her. She has most of Bella’s traits and then some – she’s boring, clumsy and downright bitter, even towards her best friend, Kate. The only other word I can use to describe her is a ‘scrounger’ – can’t she afford her own clothes? She’s too gullible and a hypocrite. She’s weak-willed and succumbs so easily for my liking. And I’m pretty sure she suffers from some form of mental disorder – schizophrenia perhaps? She constantly refers to what she calls her ‘inner goddess’ and her ‘subconscious’, who either cheer her on when there’s an opportunity for sex or take opportunities to call her a ‘dirty hoe’!(view spoiler)[ “My subconscious asks me, her eyebrow figuratively raised…My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration…My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon specs…My subconscious - she’s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt…______________________________________________My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatientlyMy inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa movesMy inner goddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers,My inner goddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina, pirouette after pirouetteMy inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms, is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast, is standing on the podium awaiting her gold medal, has back flipped off the podium and is doing cartwheels around the stadium, bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream, looks like someone snatched her ice cream. My inner goddess is not pleased” (hide spoiler)]Kill me now!I swear Kate was a much more interesting character and would have made a better female lead, but like the other few characters she was mentioned only for the sake of a story.

But not beyond anything you couldn\\'t take.\"Christian GreyCEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc._____________________________________________There are simply so many things wrong with his character that I don’t even know where to begin. What’s unacceptable is how his upbringing is used as an excuse to cover up his abusive tendencies. NO!! That does not give him the right to exert control over her and abuse her. Ana constantly tells him how uncomfortable and afraid she is with what he wants and all he can say is \\'That’s a Dom/sub thing. You’ll get used to it.\\'. Hell NO! That\\'s not BDSM. Okay children, let\\'s explore the definition of BDSM: \"form of personal relationship involving the consensual use of restraint..\" Consensual being the key word! Don\\'t tell me we have two consenting adults here. No, Ana is just a child trapped in a woman\\'s body. She has no true idea of what this lifestyle entails and is at most times in fear.If you\\'re still not convinced about how unhealthy this relationship was, this probably will convince you. To ensure he gets her to do what he wants, he manipulates her with promises of a relationship if she is willing to try his way of lifestyle. And, Ana being the fool she is lets him beat her thinking \\'Oh my, holy cow he\\'s hot\\' and \\'It’s what he wants...after all he’s done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs\\'. So in her mind, his need to control her and beat her is a form of therapy? No! That\\'s not BDSM either.I have absolutely nothing more to add. I\\'m taking my inner goddess elsewhere and grabbing a good book.Extras: Honestly this is what I imagined Christian to be like.

Absolutely horrifying, utter trash. A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published? Every single book store in Sydney is promoting this tripe, claiming it to be some kind of awesome romance novel. Are you absolutely shitting me? There is nothing romantic at all about this \\'book\\'. And I don\\'t mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin\\' thing. In fact, that\\'s what this book should be called. \\'Fifty shades of absolute-fucking-insanity-and-abuse\\'. I know at least every one star reviewer has taken the title and created their own pun with it, but fuck it, I\\'m jumping on the bandwagon too. Before I decided to read this (God help me), I kept seeing it everywhere I went, and the book store where I work was involved in the promotion among other book store chains. Typical. All me and my co-workers knew that it was smut, and a hell of a lot of it too. We even turned the book into a drinking game, and it goes as thus: Flip to a random page of the book. If it\\'s something dirty, take a drink. I do not recommend this game, for one could die from alcohol poisoning within the first round. But if you\\'re feeling adventurous... by all means. Glad I could be of service to your crazy party ideas. But anyway, let\\'s cut to my opinion of this abomination of literature. I decided to read it because it sounded like garbage, and I haven\\'t written a review about garbage in too long. I owed something to the people who actually found me worthwhile to follow on Goodreads. So I decided hell, I\\'ll review this. Brain cells I will never, ever, EVER, get back.This is literally the worst book I have ever read, and I say that about many books. But this is the worst book for a damn good reason. Let\\'s talk about what I hated about this book. The bottom line is I hated absolutely everything. And I\\'m not saying that to be funny, I\\'m saying that out of all seriousness. I didn\\'t find a single redeeming quality in this book. With the Hush, hush series we at least had the unintentional hilarity and the awesomeness of Marcie. In Twilight we had that chick who wanted to kill Bella and Tyler\\'s van. Fifty shades of Grey has no such redeeming qualities. The characters are bland and merely props to set the stage for fucking weird BDSM-ing, and the plot was lost somewhere in the vagina of the author\\'s wet dream. (Believe me, I feel weird for even typing these words.) Not to mention, even though everyone already knows this, this was originally a Twilight fan fiction called \\'Master of the universe\\' or some shitty, stupid title like that. How did such a thing get published? What, Twilight wasn\\'t horrible and abuse-glorifying enough, so we had to kick it up a notch with publishing \\'Master of the universe\\'? Are you people serious? Why is it that dumber and dumber things are getting published? Quality is almost non-existent. Fucking hell. But before I rant on for hours about that, let\\'s talk about the characters. Oh, I mean props. Yeah, props is more appropriate. Why? Because the characters, for all the personality they had may as well have been props. Our first main prop is Ana, aka Bella Swan. The plain, virginal wallflower who thinks lowly of herself whilst everyone around her just seems to freaking worship her. She is also clumsy, reads books, has divorced parents, doesn\\'t get along with her step-father, and is a brain dead moronic twat. Remind you of anyone? I wonder who you\\'re thinking of. That is a humdinger, isn\\'t it? I\\'m amazed how many women are not pissed off with her complete lack of sense and self-respect. She lets a man abuse her physically and emotionally, and allows him to satiate his ever-growing need to control her completely, passing it off as some cute obsessive habit. And even if she has doubts and runs away, she comes running back to him only seconds after. How are people not pissed off about this? Seriously? Not to mention she has zero personality, zero brain-cells, and zero common sense. Her character serves no purpose other than becoming some abusive asshole\\'s sex toy. And let\\'s not forget our second main prop, Christian Grey, aka Edward Cullen, aka creepy-stalker-sociopathic-megalomaniacal-abusive-horrifying-asshole. The fact that he has fangirls in the real world has pretty much ruined my faith in mankind, and the new generation. Christian Gray pretty much pushes the limits that Edward Cullen, Patch, Daniel and others have yet to push due to their PG ratings, but fuck does Christian Grey push those fucking limits. He physically abuses Ana, and it somehow gets excused on the account that she was briefly aroused by it. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?? SERIOUSLY?? Fuck my life. He also decides what she should eat, what she should wear, how she should act, speak, communicate with him, where she can and can\\'t go or what she can and can\\'t do, threatens her constantly even with physical violence, and the list goes on. I kid you not. He even has this set out as a contract (which by the way is repeated at least 5 times in the fucking book). Here\\'s another example of how romantic this mother fucker is:\"I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don\\'t, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.\"See? Romantic as freaking Mel Gibson. And by the way, the women who find this guy romantic need some serious therapy. Seriously. Harsh I know, but finding this guy romantic is like like excusing the actions of a child-molester because he has nice hair. This is not romantic. This is ABUSIVE and WRONG on sooooo many levels.I don\\'t know why they decided to plant this book in the general romance section. This is not romantic. And don\\'t give me the \\'IT\\'S MEANT TO BE BDSM, SO IT\\'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL DOM VS SUB\\'. This goes way beyond the good ol\\' BDSM theme and just ends up treading into abusive territory. Christian takes these aspects into the relationship where he ends up not only controlling a woman sexually, but also emotionally, and deliberately moulding her into not just a sex partner, but an ideal of what he wants her to be and leaves her no room for her individuality and instead brands it as \\'punishable\\'. That\\'s not part of the BDSM jig. I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s not. Why people even call this romantic is beyond me. I already mentioned the abusive aspects of this so called relationship, but other than that it was a relationship built on air. Since neither of the characters had any personality outside their sex drives, they had nothing that they saw in each other. They couldn\\'t relate to each other, they didn\\'t share any common interests, they didn\\'t do any good for each other, outside the sexy stuff. And at the end they want to pass it off as though the two are actually in love? Give me a break. Watching people get swooped at by magpies is more romantic that this garbage.The plot? There was no plot. Seriously, I could not find it. ANYWHERE. I searched and searched but alas, my search has left me unrewarded. Let me explain in a quick paragraph how this book goes:\\'Girl meets some guy. Some guy is hot. Girl thinks some guy is hot. Hot some-guy shows up where girl who thinks some-guy is hot works. Hot some-guy asks out girl, takes her virginity. Stuff happens. Hot some-guy introduces girl (who thinks he\\'s hot, by the way) to his BDSM sex dungeon, and the next half of the book is spent pondering whether or not girl (who thinks some-guy is hot, in case it wasn\\'t mentioned enough in the book) wants to indulge in hot some-guy\\'s fantasies. Also the hot some-guy takes complete control over girl (did I mention she thinks he\\'s hot?) who seems to be totally okay with it. More stuff happens. Girl gets spanked too hard, breaks up with hot some-guy. The end.\\'That\\'s it. That\\'s the whole book. And the whole \\'Ohhh Christian has secrets\\' bullcrap in the blurb? Bullcrap. His secrets are mentioned in only 5% of the book and drive the plot nowhere. The book is only about how some asshole wants to control some stupid girl. The other characters are barely relevant. They were just more props whose only role was to be interested in the \\'relationship\\' between Ana and Christian. They didn\\'t seem to be interested in anything else. They could be buttering toast and thinking \\'I wonder how hard Christian is fucking Ana right now.\\'An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its\\' descendants. You know what they say, you can polish a turd, but it will still be a turd.

For years I\\'d chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you, but who was I kidding? All I ever wanted to do was write. So I sat down, and I did. I did write.I\\'m actually not shitting you. I thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on Wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and I wrote a lot of crap: I tried to write a play, and then I tried poetry, and then I wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. Novels is a stretch. I wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. And they actually did. Remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? Or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? I feel the same level of shame when I think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking I actually had something.About a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, I posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher\\'s slushpiles. A vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn\\'t want my work, and I did the undoable: I argued with them.As I write this, I\\'m practically convulsing with embarrassment. Vanity Publisher, if you\\'re reading this, please forget I ever existed. But if you can\\'t do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research.In some ways, having read this book, I finally feel like I identify with that vanity publisher: I read someone\\'s irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and I got so mad I broke a window with my face.(Peeps, if you think E.L. James hasn\\'t tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on YouTube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.)I just...I haven\\'t read a book this awful since Revealing Eden (but let\\'s not open that can of worms). It was like an acid trip. Am I reading this, I thought? Is this actually a published book? Are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage?I feel like this book insulted me, really. I feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? It\\'s as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved Ana of her brain. How could you...? Why would you...? Why is she...?I just...I have no words. I have no words to explain this protagonist. None at all. I have more to say about the love interest, who\\'s like a more threatening Charles Manson but with only one brainwashed follower (Ana). This guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and Ana doesn\\'t think this is weird?What the fucking fuck?And of course there\\'s the whole \"inner goddess\" shit and Ana thinking that it\\'s sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word \"vagina\" during a sex scene. \"Oh, he touched my vagina\".Yeah, excuse me while I tame my boner!I felt so uncomfortable reading this book. Now, let\\'s be honest here: I read porn. Of course I read porn. Anyone over sixteen who says they\\'ve never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. But this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here\\'s the kicker: I read it alone. I was reading it alone in my living room, and I felt uncomfortable inside my own head. What the fuck does that tell you?I don\\'t want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. It\\'s written like horrendous fanfiction. There are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and I don\\'t know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had.What are the redeeming features? I don\\'t know. The blurb sounds interesting. That\\'s about it.But what is it about this book that\\'s captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? The absurdly stupid protagonist? The pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? The relationship in which only one party is actually interested in BDSM, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? The terrible writing? The awful cover art? The cheap, thin binding? A story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from Twilight?There is nothing enjoyable about this book. This book is garbage. There are no two ways about it: it is shit. Awful, awful shit. And I\\'m not sorry for saying so. This is my fucking opinion, and I\\'m damn well going to voice it. This book can kiss my ass.

DNF @55%. Review edited February 12, 2015“Sex is more than an act of pleasure, it's the ability to be able to feel so close to a person, so connected, so comfortable that it's almost breathtaking to the point you feel you can’t take it. And at this moment you're a part of them. - Author unknown - I've had a rather long list of issues when I decided to abandon ship. FSoShit is garbage and if I had read a paperback I would have burned the fucking offending thing. It's a total mystery to me why this book ever saw the light of day because, let's face it, the writing is incredibly juvenile. The story and characters are extremely poorly written and I couldn't for the life of me connect with the dumb, clumsy, naïve and immature heroine. Also, the slimy whacko didn't deserve to be called hero. Christian is a highly manipulative, abusive and stalker-ish asshole. His whispers didn't endear him to me either. He came off as a total creep. I honestly don't understand what Ana saw in him, yet on the other hand, I didn't get it why Christian would stalk that bland and vapid wallflower. In any event, these two deserved each other and Ana obviously enjoyed Grey's blunt and crude approach.The whole contract business was pretty much mind-boggling. I don't believe that a healthy and consensual Dom/sub relationship could be based upon such crappy and ridiculous rules.Christian, the rich Superman (sarcasm), deflowered our wallflower in a way that's not even worthy of losing any words over that pathetic fuck. So, you did guess right. I neither found the sex to be hot nor erotic. At.All. Thus, I'd better buy him a ticket to the next Mars expedition stat. That would ensure that Mr. Grey would not return to our cozy place called Mother Earth.FSoG lacked depth and emotion big time. Except of disgust and anger I felt nothing towards these pathetic main protagonists and their fucked up trip bored me to tears.The winking smileys irritated the hell outta me and all that inner goddess shit made me almost blow a fuse. Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Would you give me a break already? I've read a variety of erotica books and I do enjoy great smexin' that comes with some kind of depth and great characterization. However, I'm not sorry to say that FSoG is ranking among the worst erotica books I've ever read.What's seriously bugging me as well is the fact that the general public thinks that FSoShit provides almost every woman's erotic fantasy. I don't criticize readers who loved this book but I'm criticizing the media coverage. I don't appreciate it when these people claim to know that's what a general majority of women love to read and want in real life (or in the bedroom for that matter). Seriously? Never. Ever. FSoG is bad erotica. It's bad BDSM too. When people say FSoG is “empowering women in their sexuality,” then I think something is seriously wrong. Never ever could this story empower me in my sexuality. What in God’s name is on their minds? I can do it all by myself with my very healthy hand, and I can gladly say that my boyfriend is empowering me just fine and is taking care of my needs. Thank you very much. BTW, my boyfriend is not an abusive and manipulative stalker. Oh, yes, now it dawns on me…my boyfriend is real.Bottom line, the barely there plot and the characters were overly shallow, underdeveloped, immature and boring. The amateurish writing killed any desire to read anything else by this author in the future. And last but not least, my inner goddess was so fucking relieved when she had to quit eventually. It was a very tedious and crappy experience and I wish I had never bought this book, let alone attempted to go through this rubbish. I was in dire need of bleaching my brain.Christopher Hitchens said… Everybody does have a book in them, but in most cases that's where it should stay.

Many people are praising it but I’m simply not into erotica, it’s too cheap for me. But here I am in the mind of the innocent waiting to be devoured by the big bad wolf. Sounds pornographic, doesn’t it? That’s because it is…Christian Grey. A hot dude that melts a woman’s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters out there but he doesn’t get to me. His dominance is too much for me to handle and his attitude tends to be annoying and slimy. Plus he’s just wrong in the head so there’s no need to add more about this creep.Anastasia is an immature insecure desperate idiot who wants to become the whore of Babylon. She just wants to listen to her inner goddess (wtf?!) and have creepy monkey sex with Grey. She has no personality nor will whatsoever, she gets excited over the smallest and most idiotic things you can imagine and even though she sees how wrong Grey (the sick f*ck) is, she still goes for it. She’s always mooning over Grey like he’s some kind of god that she’s supposed to worship. He tells her that he doesn’t want a serious relationship just sex and she’s still ok with it. Why? Just because he’s hot? He’s a damn disgusting pervert. He hurt her the first time they made love, she was a virgin for Christ’s sake (and I don’t buy the crap with it being perfect, surely she had vaginal cracks after that), and is treating her like a slave. Even though he’s a successful businessman and he’s rich and famous he still can be a psychopath. Just watch American Psycho and you’ll know what I’m talking about.Now to pick on one of my biggest problems regarding this book: THE CONTRACT. WTF may I ask? Signing paperwork in order to have sex with him? Is he a natural hazard or what? I get the whole Hey look at me I’m badass, I have my own company and helicopter gig ‘cause the guy is stinking rich but the contract??? Isn’t anyone getting angry with this?I guess not... “Why would I do that?”“To please me” Wtf?? All women want to please him? Why? ‘Cause he’s hot? He’s a perverted assh*le that’s what he is. He’s acting like he owns everyone! Aren’t you guys angry? “I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don’t, I shall punish you, and you will learn,” Learn this! *kicks him in the groin* Creep! “It’s about gaining your trust and your respect, so you’ll let me exert my will over you.” Heh *right eye twitches* exert my will *eye twitches again*Aren’t you guys angry with this yet??…Question for all the people who gave this book great scores. If Grey wasn’t so hot would you still have given it such great ratings? I doubt you would. So this means that the reason why you love the book is mainly Christian Grey being hot and an uber alpha? Shallow much? Or maybe you’re into all the Christian Grey induced monkey sex and torture. Psycho much? But who am I to judge.This book is just a desperate woman’s sick fantasy to be treated like a sex slave. I’m sorry but it doesn’t work for me. I DNF’d this because I find it disgusting and degrading.

The hero Christian Grey admits that he is “Fifty shades of Fu*#&ed up,” which makes the reader want to delve in and learn about each of those fifty shades.

(by which i mean i have looked a man in the eye - you don\\'t need to know my life.) so it\\'s very tame. if disney were going to make a bdsm movie, they would use the same contract. because real suspension?? it looks more like this: (view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]or this:(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]or this:(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]what they do is what teenagers do when they are still in their experimentation stage. okay - so that\\'s out of the way - this is bondage-lite. moving on to the rest of it, because this had a lot fewer scenes of erotic journeying than i had feared. there are still plenty, but the first scene isn\\'t until after page 100, and after that, it isn\\'t taking over the whole book. but there\\'s still enough for you people who aren\\'t reading this for the articles. twilightthere is a lot of debate about whether this reads like twilight, because it started out as twilight fanfic. some people say \"yes\" some people say \"nooo.\" i am here to break that tie. OF COURSE IT READS LIKE TWILIGHT!!! are you mad?? ALL the twilightisms are there: the \"i\\'m bad for you\" speeches, the emphasis on smells, the ineffable attraction of a perfect and wealthy man to an underdescribed, clumsy and tongue-tied female who is all \"who, me??\" with all of the self-doubt and self-esteem issues, all the \"how can such a perfect specimen fall for li\\'l ole me??\", the seeecrets and the endless endless repetitions.and those repetitions make the book so frequently annoying.but that\\'s not her fault, not if that is what she is going for. it\\'s actually quite remarkable that she was able to mimic meyer\\'s style to that extent. sure, it\\'s irritating as hell, but as an homage, it\\'s quite accomplished.i have decided to interpret her linguistic quirks as homage, not as weak writing. feel free to disagree - it\\'s just my take on it. (although the writing is frequently weak in other areas as well. i am just feeling generous.) languagefirst of all, e.l. james is british. and yet - because this is twilight fanfic, she had to set it in washington state. but no one told her how we talk. pssst - we use our present perfect tense differently than you do. yes, even those of us who are/were lit majors. when americans say things like \"i\\'ve not been there\" etc, it sounds pompous. sorry to you americans who do talk like that, but it does. it sounds affected. especially in erotic fiction set in washington state. miscellaneousthere are so many gasps in here, it may as well have been titled the great gaspy. i personally have never heard a man gasp with lust in response to something i have said. how do i do this? does he have a breathing disorder? why are his eyes always darkening? i have never noticed this phenomenon, but it is a staple of romance novels. i was not aware this could actually happen. biting of the lips, linen, inner goddess, subconscious, medulla oblongata, blushing, control freak... get used to these words. there are at least 50 occurrences of these words on every page. charactersi do not understand his attraction to our heroine. she never says anything interesting, except in her emails. those emails are the best part of this book. she shows more personality there than in any conversation, and that\\'s just odd, to me. i\\'m not sure why i was expecting much more from a character whose favorite book is tess, because you know how i feel about that book, but i was glad to see thomas hardy pop up frequently, even if it is my least favorite of his books. and christian is also unstable and mercurial and full of anger towards peccadilloes. and - god - his food issues. even without his sexual needs, this guy is a piece of work. i\\'m not sure i could put up with someone so changeable, even if he was an uncommonly gorgeous billionaire who wanted to buy me old and expensive books... gotta draw the line somewhere.plus, once i saw the leather bed, i\\'d be outta there. that\\'s just gross, all sticky and germ-encouraging. i don\\'t know - i wanted to write a much better review for this book - there was so much i wanted to say, but i am feeling lazy right now. i feel weird giving it three stars, because there was so much about this book i didn\\'t like, but the three-stars here is more of a \"i thought it was going to be so much worse than it is\" and my deeply charitable heart which overlooks weaknesses in favor of an author\\'s zeal. but here, enjoy this link of gilbert gottfried reading this book aloud:http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/677...and here are three other options, if you\\'d rather giggle: fifty shades of grey pussy catsa coupla shades of taupefifty shames of earl greycome to my blog!

I know, I know, my review of this isn\\'t really needed, everybody\\'s talking about this book, everybody\\'s got the general gist of what it\\'s about. But I\\'ve spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I\\'ve been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately after finishing it and before I started (and finished) the other two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars, I expressed all that Fifty Shades of Grey had made me feel: annoyed, frustrated, confused, and also entertained. I have since then felt like I have much more to add.The reason I personally think that opinions differ so greatly on these novels is not because people have different sexual tastes. For some, yeah, this will come into play. However, I think the main reason is that this book and the characters send out a confusing mix of messages. When I finished Fifty Shades of Grey, I had no idea what kind of book I\\'d just read. Was it BDSM erotica? Or the tale of a man\\'s childhood abuse and how this impacted on his sex life later on? Were Christian Grey\\'s sexual tastes supposed to be erotic or wrong? Let me tell those of you who haven\\'t read this: it isn\\'t clear.This book appears to be an erotic BDSM romance at face value. But Ana makes it clear early on that she doesn\\'t want that kind of relationship, that Christian is \"fifty shades of fucked up\", that the way he behaves isn\\'t right, but is actually the result of an abusive upbringing. Ana later contradicts her early decision and gets all pouty when Christian won\\'t play kinky with her... and yet the previous time he\\'d done it she spent the evening crying and feeling sorry for herself. Some people seem to see Christian as the big bad man who abuses a weak young woman. This is not the case. There is nothing, I repeat nothing, that happens between the two of them that Ana doesn\\'t give consent to. Sure, she may whine about it afterwards, or use the excuse that she doesn\\'t want to lose him, but she makes the choices, she holds the power.Here\\'s what I think is the ultimate problem with Fifty Shades of Grey: Ms James\\' terrible writing. It\\'s nothing new, she even admitted it herself, but that is why we all can\\'t figure out what it is about this book that makes it some parts entertaining, some parts annoying as fuck. Because I\\'m trying to categorise this so I can begin to understand it, so that I can form my opinion and write my review accordingly. But we cannot understand what doesn\\'t make sense. And James\\' characterisation does not make any sense at all. She writes Ana as a naive student at the mercy of Christian\\'s abusive past, then she writes Ana as a sexual manipulator who actually likes BDSM. Is Christian sexy or a victim? I\\'ll tell you: he\\'s both and neither, because James cannot create characters and relationships to save her life. She contradicts herself, she changes her mind without logical reason. This is why it is pointless analysing the relationship between Ana and Christian. One minute it\\'s sexy, the next minute it\\'s fucked up. One minute it\\'s BDSM, the next minute it\\'s abuse. How do you accurately review a book that changes its mind every two minutes?I also feel I need to say something about BDSM. Any more than a small amount of kinky doesn\\'t really interest me, but it doesn\\'t bother me either if it is between consenting adults. However, there are two things I can say about this matter in Fifty Shades of Grey: 1) it really isn\\'t that kinky, and 2) for the most part, this isn\\'t really a BDSM relationship (I don\\'t think the author actually understands what one is). I can\\'t say that I\\'m experienced in visiting those kind of clubs down the dark allies of Soho, but I\\'ve done not a small amount of reading on the psychological aspect of BDSM relationships. I have a keen interest in feminism and I have often wondered if something like this is nothing but a hindrance to the progress of women and equality. I would conclude from my reading that it is not. Firstly, BDSM relationships are about give and take. The dom and the sub each give one another what they want/need. It isn\\'t about abuse, it isn\\'t about selfishly taking what you want, and because these relationships involve relinquishing control to another person, there is a deep amount of trust required. Also, it is important to note that the power of the dom is an illusion, the sub holds all the power, they say how far it goes, when it stops, what is too much. The key thing is that both of them get something out of it. Which is why the relationship in Fifty Shades of Grey can only be called BDSM when Ana does an abrupt u-turn on her opinions and decides she wants a bit of spankiness. The parts where she is upset about the relationship Christian wants - that is not BDSM. The parts where she reluctantly allows him to get his way - that is not BDSM. I think there is nothing wrong with BDSM erotica. I think there is nothing wrong with doms, subs, sex slaves, whatever... if that is what the person wants. But Fifty Shades of Grey is about 10% BDSM relationship and 90% bad writing that just fucks with your head until you\\'re not sure what the hell you\\'re reading. Ms James has created one mess of a book, whether you\\'ll look at her mess and see something entertaining or horrific, well that\\'s kinda just like looking at this picture and asking whether you see a rabbit or a duck.

Paging through this \"published\" version makes me more embarrassed for the author than I was when it was in the fanfic domain, and it DEFINITELY made me lose respect for The Writer\\'s Coffee Shop.Most distracting is the schizophrenic voice of the main character, Ana. In one paragraph, Ana\\'s words sound like those of a quasi-literate teenager; in the next paragraph she uses uber-literate words like \"gamine\". Are we supposed to believe that she\\'s naive or sophisticated? Un-self-aware or articulate?Add in culture confusion: Ana is supposed to be American, but the author (who is from the U.K.) keeps having Ana use Britishisms! Her roommate isn\\'t \"sick\" like American people are, she\\'s \"ill\"; Ana doesn\\'t \"grab her bag\" before going out the door, she \"gathers her satchel\". Ana\\'s voice fails to consistently ring true for an American girl.Yet, the worst literary crime is the outright misuse of language. Says Ana at one point: \"The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor.\" Um...terminal velocity occurs when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag, and it can\\'t be reached by a controlled-speed mechanism that draws an object upward (such as an elevator). Even if the author didn\\'t know this, the editor should have caught it.The problems don\\'t end there. From cliches (without a lick of irony or humor, Ana is described as putting the \"pedal to the metal\" as she drives), to awkward sentences, to nonsensical metaphors, this work is amateurish. There\\'s nothing wrong with being an amateur, but there IS something wrong with charging people money for something that hasn\\'t been professionally edited. If this author wants to be taken seriously, she should take the time to learn about writing craft and align herself with an editing house that will turn her writing into serious work.

I\\'m actually very thankful that I read it before any of my GR friends or anyone I knew, because I feel like if I read it now, after hearing all the hype, it would probably disappoint.People have very strong reactions to Fifty Shades and just to put in my two cents: you read different books for different reasons. In my opinion!!! ...: Was this book a great piece of literature? No. Were these characters ones whom you could write grad school theses about? No. But you know what? I loved the romance, I loved the chemistry, and I enjoyed myself tremendously while reading it - it had me grinning ridiculously for hours. That\\'s what I wanted from this book, and that\\'s what I got, so for me, that was enough.Post Post Script on October 9, 2012I greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book. For those making hateful comments: you don\\'t like the book, people who did are apparently driving you crazy, so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews!! Age-old rule: if you don\\'t have anything nice to say, don\\'t say anything at all.Post Post Post Script on January 13, 2017Almost 500 comments on this review, but none for awhile, so not sure why I\\'m coming back to it now. I started reading the most recent comments though and my own review, and frankly I wanted to delete some of it, but figured that was ridiculous at this point. I wouldn\\'t write this same review were I to read it now, but that was what I thought that morning at the time right after I read it, so it is what it is. Finally watched the movie recently, which is probably what brought me round to this, and for the record: yes, Christian does f*cked up shit (they don\\'t even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life, I would have advised her to get a restraining order, because wtf. But it\\'s not. Anyway. I wrote what I wrote; I was in my early 20s; I liked it. Peace xoSincerely, Juliana * Actual Review Begins Here * 5+ stars. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I still feel somewhat under the spell of this book. I\\'m so ... beguiled by it ;-) (book allusion). It was honestly an amazing read - and one which I meant to just skim a few sample pages of, but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish. I wasn\\'t even sure I wanted to write a review, because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice.This ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances I have read. In some ways, I feel conflicted like Anastasia when I say that: my instinct is to say that can\\'t be, because of what their relationship revolves around / how it\\'s constructed ... but somehow it can be and it\\'s true. Anastasia, Christian, and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel. Even though its counterintuitive, I can\\'t help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful, complex, and emotional ones I\\'ve read in the romance genre.It\\'s one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books I read and knock down their ratings half a star, because when put on the same scale they don\\'t compare. I had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing, both because I was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor. I had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as I read, but I was also extremely nervous, because real BDSM sub/dom books are not my thing, and so while I was falling increasingly in love with Ana and Christian with every new page I read, I was also terrified that I was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top BDSM scene. Thankfully, that never happened, and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end.{ Not What I Expected }I\\'m not normally a BDSM book reader, but this was so, so, SO much more than just that. I don\\'t think that I have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic. I write seemingly because I have no personal experience, so no idea, but to me it read that way. It was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes. Instead, it\\'s woven throughout, showing us how it impacts and affects both characters. Ana and Christian remain Ana and Christian in those scenes, in the sense that it doesn\\'t feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota. I\\'m not even sure I want to categorize this book as erotica, because that seems so limiting. (There was hot - intense - chemistry, don\\'t get me wrong, and I definitely had some turn-the-AC-up moments).{ Loved our Heroine: Anastasia / Ana (21) }Anastasia was one of the best heroines, because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal! Not over-the-top for effect, but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes. She\\'s a virgin, has no experience with men, and didn\\'t know anything about BDSM, so of course she\\'s going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it\\'s \"right\" or it\\'s \"wrong\" or if she even feels comfortable doing it. She also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with Christian and wants to be in a relationship with him. Ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy. Her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and I could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways, thinking those exact same things, and feeling those exact same conflicts.Ana is strong - she\\'s somewhat shy and quiet, but like all real people, you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet, but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub Christian first thinks she might be. Ana examines her motivations and feelings when she\\'s confused or unsure - not only about what she should do, but about what she wants to do and what Christian wants from her. The story is told in first-person, which is sometimes iffy for me, but it worked well here; Ana\\'s tone as narrator is smart, self-aware, and immensely likable.{ Adored our Hero: Christian (27) }Christian is one of the best heroes. He\\'s intense and dark and I know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this, but I actually found him to be so accessible. There are still things we need to know about his history, obviously - I have some guesses, but don\\'t know anything for sure. Nonetheless, he also felt like the most authentic BDSM dom I could ever read because he\\'s not just that - he\\'s a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life, personality, and mannerisms, so that it\\'s integral to his character, even when we see him around other characters who don\\'t know about this part of his life.Christian is possessive, a little stalkerish, domineering (no duh), authoritarian, elusive, mercurial - all of those things and more. He is also one of the most tender, tortured, and sensitive heroes I\\'ve ever read. His despair and his need for Ana is his life are like living, breathing things and they jump off the page. He also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires, though he discovers and faces new things through Ana\\'s questions and confrontations. He needs to dominate and control his partner, but he also needs Ana, so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that \"more,\" but ends up wanting it himself as well.{ An Unbelievable Connection and Relationship }From the first page of their encounter, the chemistry between Anastasia and Christian was off the charts. It was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense. Their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they\\'re coming from such different places, you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together, trying to understand what the other wants, what they themselves want, etc. The dialogue, the emails, the EVERYTHING between them is a m a z i n g !!! I had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book. This goes back to my first point, but I was just so amazed by how realistic their relationship seemed, despite the BDSM sub/dom factor, which to me seems so foreign. It was complex, difficult, lovely, distressing, uplifting, intense, hopeful.{ This Book Felt So Honest }And I mean this in multiple ways: the main characters, their relationship, and the subject matter. Reading this book feels like an intimate act, because Ana and Christian are truly laid bare for us; yes, there are still things about his past we don\\'t know, but who they are, their essentials, are revealed to us. Their relationship is so honest, and I mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it. Within the book, I so, SO loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts, that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out, figure out what this is between them. Loved, loved, LOVED it! Also, for the reader how their connection is shown, both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very, very honest. It wasn\\'t porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink\\'s sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another.{ Overall Fantastic }Surprisingly funny and sweet! Fantastic secondary characters. No evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story. Subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension. Complex characters. Etc, etc.{ Ending of the Book / Series } (no spoilers)*Important to know that Ana and Christian\\'s story does not end here.*The ending is jarring, though I had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book\\'s summary ( Fifty Shades Darker , due out September 15). I think the buildup should definitely have been extended, because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me.As little a thing as it is, the fact that the end says \"End of Part One\" and this isn\\'t viewed as Book 1 and the next as Book 2, really made a difference to me. Gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission. I love where the book / series titles come from, lol (Christian\\'s remark to Ana that he\\'s \"fifty shades of f*cked-up\"). Note: All together, there will be three books.For those interested but unsure, Google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you\\'ll like the book or not: http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wR7...

This book has put me off sex for ever and ever.I know I said I was never going to touch this with a ten-foot pole, but then this happened: Basically, my co-blogger dared me to read the books after a joke about the author, or I was never allowed to diss the books again.… the joke wasn’t worth it.This piece of shit, this sorry excuse for a book is without a doubt the worst piece of literature fanfiction I have ever read. I have never suffered so much in my life. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Normally I’d add a short summary of the plot, but there is no fucking plot. Boy meets girl, boy is a fucking psychopath, girl does as she’s told, lots of sex, lots of whining. The parts that didn’t have sex bored me out of my goddamn mind, and the parts that did have sex were so absurd and revolting that I couldn’t go on reading without raging on Goodreads about it.I seriously cannot wrap my head around the fact that this is a bestseller. That women all over the world adore this book, and adore Christian Grey. The man is an abusive stalker and the fact that women are fantasising about this fuckwit sets our society back about 500 years. Thanks for that, wankers.Reasons why you should run away from Christian Grey and possibly shoot and castrate himOh boy, where do I start? * He tracks her fucking phone. Strike one. \"How did you find me?\"\"I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.\"Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is that legal? Stalker, my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that\\'s still floating in my brain, but somehow, because it\\'s him, I don\\'t mind. Because it’s not stalking if the guy is hot!* “Well, if you were mine, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.” Strike two.* “You should steer clear from me.” Strike three, and he should be out. Go home, thank you for playing.But the list goes on.* Christian’s endless commanding and controlling Anastasia. “Sit.” “Come.” “Eat.” Like she’s a fucking dog. Worst of all, Anastasia would happily wag her tail and roll over for him.* More stalker tendencies: he knows where she lives without her telling him. When Kate and Ana move house to Seattle, he again knows where she lives without her telling him. And then, when Ana flies to Georgia to escape, not only does he know where her mother lives, he also knows her mother’s last name, knows which flight Ana is on, and follows her to Georgia. Without her permission. And he happens to stay in the hotel she’s having dinner at. Fucking hell. If that’s not an alarm bell, I don’t know what is. This guy is fucking insane.* Bipolar tendencies. One moment, he’s all nice, the next, he becomes dark and cold. Just the mere mention of another guy gets him angry. He becomes all moody when there’s another male presence around Ana. It’s sickening.* He gets a thrill out of how young Ana looks with pigtails.* Not only does he tell her when to eat, he also orders her drinks and food for her, without taking into account what she wants. “Is this what our err… relationship will be like?” I whisper. “You, ordering me around?”“Yes,” he murmurs. The BDSM contract is the perfect example of this: “The Submissive will ensure she achieves a minimum of seven hours sleep a night when she is not with the Dominant.”“The Submissive will not snack between meals, with the exception of fruit.”“During the term, the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the Dominant.”“The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions.”\"The Submissive shall accept whippings, floggings, spankings, caning, paddling or any other discipline the Dominant should decide to administer, without hesitation, enquiry or complaint.”“The Submissive shall not touch or pleasure herself sexually without permission from the Dominant.”“The Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do without hesitation or argument.”“The Submissive shall not look directly into the eyes of the Dominant except when specifically instructed to do so.” Not only that, but you will undergo any beauty treatment I tell you, wax whenever and wherever I tell you, and be available every weekend. I really hope I don’t need to explain how sick this is.* The guy is an absolute control freak. \"You\\'ve not eaten very much.\"\"I\\'ve had enough.\" “Three oysters, four bites of cod, and one asparagus stalk, no potatoes, no nuts, no olives, and you’ve not eaten all day.” He’s keeping a fucking inventory of the things she eats. He also keeps track of how many orgasms he’s given her. And he gets angry when Ana decides to go away for a bit, even if it’s just to visit her mother. “Palm-twitchingly mad.”* He doesn’t give two shits about what Ana wants. Ana has mentioned a dozen times about how she doesn’t want Christian to buy her things. So he buys her 14,000-dollar-worth old books, a Macbook, a Blackberry, and a fucking car.* He’s obviously a creep. He gives her grades like she’s a bloody school girl. Worst of all – she’s proud of it too. “Swallowing semen… well, you get an A in that.”I flush, and my inner goddess smacks her lips together with glowing pride. Just.. yikes.He also says he’d “pay good money” to see her consult with a gynaecologist. What the fuck is wrong with you?!And he has rape tendencies: “No one’s ever said no to me before. And it’s so – hot.” * He doesn’t like it when she asks personal questions, yet has no qualms with invading her privacy three times over.* He wants to own Ana. He wants her to be his possession. Like she’s a fucking car.Even more alarm bells:1. “You scare me when you’re angry.”2. He spanks her so hard that she can’t sit down from the pain. “Holy fuck it hurts.”3. About the spanking: “During the whole alarming process I felt demeaned, debased and abused.”4. To which he replies: “I am tempted to drive back over there to ensure that you don’t sit down for a week, rather than an evening.”5. Ana never cries, until she meets Christian. Suddenly, she cries all the time.6. “Take some Advil – this is not a request. And don’t drive your Beetle. I will know.”7. “If I listened to my body, I’d be in Alaska by now.”“Alaska is very cold and no place to run. I would find you. I can track your cell phone – remember?”8. “Will he ever give me a break? He is suffocating me.”9. “He’d probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me.”10. “Holy cow. He wants to hurt me… how do I deal with this? I can’t hide the horror on my face.” Right, I think there are enough examples here. This is beyond fucked up.On to the writing. It was horrible. Every single word was overused. I am going to shoot someone if I ever have to hear “oh my” or “holy cow” again. If I have to read one more mention about how she bites her lip, or how s/he gasps, or how their breaths hitch. Worst of all – “down there”. You’re already being racy by writing BDSM. At least use proper terms. Vagina. Pussy. Vulva. Lady bottom. Muff. Vajayjay. Hoo-ha. Bojingo. Box. Cave. Clam. Flower. Coin purse. Cooch. Cunt. Twat. Dragon\\'s lair. Slot machine. Taco. Fanny. Beaver. Gash. Honey pot. Sausage wallet. Venus fly trap. ANYTHING.The subconscious/inner goddess shit annoyed me to no end. “ I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious - she\\'s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.”“My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.”“My inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms.”“My inner goddess is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast.” It was like the author was desperately trying to make Anastasia sound intelligent, especially when she used terms such as “medulla oblongata”. When we all know she’s a dumb cunt, because she signs contracts without reading them. The fact that she keeps running back to Christian also signifies that she has an IQ of a garden gnome.There was also the constant need to remind us that Christian Grey is good-looking. Seriously, every time she saw him there was mention of how hot he was, and every time she thought of him, as well. “Adonis”, “Michelangelo’s David has nothing on him”, someone pass me a bucket.Then there are the inaccuracies. Anastasia has to be some kind of Superwoman. No hangover after drinking tequila for the first time. She’s never been drunk in her life, yet she can wolf down a massive breakfast easily the next morning. Then, when her virginity is absolutely destroyed by Christian (literally – “he slams into me” / “as he rips through my virginity”), she comes twice and is happy to do it again right away. She has no pain whatsoever. She’s also perfectly able to take it doggy style after just losing her virginity, because why the fuck not.On top of that, she\\'s instantly exceptional at everything. Must be great, to be a natural. No awkwardness whatsoever.At one point, she gasps and swallows at the same time. I tried to do it. I don’t think it’s possible.Things that I think were supposed to be sexy but really weren’t“The walls and ceiling are a deep, dark burgundy, giving a womb-like effect to the spacious room.”“Two orgasms… coming apart at the seams, like the spin cycle on a washing machine, wow.”“He slowly inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it round and round, stroking the front wall of my vagina.” After which he sticks his bloody thumb in her mouth.“I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He’s my very own Christian Grey flavour popsicle.” Not only is that disgusting, but I find it hard to believe that she thinks giving blowjobs is a turn-on. I find nothing sexy about testing my gag reflex repeatedly.As if Christian read my mind, he goes, “Don’t you have a gag reflex?” Words every girl wants to hear.“My heated blood pools low in my belly.” Is she on her period?“Stop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I don’t care who gets in with us.” Whoa there, cowboy.“I’d really like to claim your ass, Anastasia.” What, you’re going to put a flag up there?The tampon scene. Things I learned from Fifty Shades of Grey:* If your future mother-in-law practically catches you having sex with her son, don’t worry – she’ll be delighted to meet you, because it means her son is not gay.* Find someone who’s willing to be your Dominant. That way, you never have to make any decisions again! He’ll decide what and when you eat and drink, when and how long you sleep, what you wear, what you drive, when you exercise… easy!* Your first time will not be painful, even if you’ve never masturbated before. Not even if he slams into you! You won’t feel a thing. In fact, you’ll like it and you’ll come twice. Then you’ll want to do it again straight away!* You look plain. That’s okay. You’ll still have three hot guys fighting over you.* When a girl you barely know is drunk, it’s probably a good idea to take her back to your place, take off her trousers, and sleep in the same bed as her.* You can’t get pregnant when you’re on your period. (Honestly, I’m surprised this fuckwit hasn’t knocked anyone up before Ana) Christian Grey, I hope you get a blowjob by a motherfucking shark. You sick son-of-a-bitch.That is all.

Wow! Just Wow!!This book is 5+ stars for me!! It is my favorite kind of story.

Well, that was me while reading this book, I couldn't concentrate to get anything done :)There are a lot of reviews on this book, and obviously the majority love it, so I am simply going to explain some of the reasons that this story grabbed hold of my heart and wouldn't let go.First, I am a total sucker for the tortured hero and you would be hard pressed to find a hero more tortured that our own beloved Christian Grey. That said, the fact that he is a gazillionaire at age 27 is nothing to shake a stick at! Christian's intensity and focus is what really captured me in all this, I keep having to remind myself how old he is. The chemistry between Anastasia & Christian is just off the friggin' charts, I swear at times I could feel it coming right off the pages, from the moment she 'fell' into his office!! :)I really enjoyed the BDSM element, it wasn't necessarily heavy but intense, especially listening to Christian tell Ana that he WANTED to hurt her and why. When he said he had never had to explain it before and knew he wasn't explaining well just melted my heart. There is such a vulnerable, sweet boy underneath that gorgeous domineering man!Obviously you can tell I am completely smitten with Christian, but let me tell you a little bit about why I completely love Ana too. Even though she is an innocent, oh and I mean really innocent, I can't help but love her fire! Yes, just like the rest of the female population she has fallen completely under Christian's spell but she is not willing to just submit to his every whim - She's feisty but conflicted, I love the emotion!!

Not even!And after seeing this:And that has got to be the LEAST disgusting/creepy/nonsensical thing that slime bag has said. THE LEAST! No effing way. I'm only seventeen-going-on-eighteen. I have a future to look forward to. And I need brain cells for that. But you should watch this for the lolz.And this \", 'https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/322952362?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1'), ('Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1)', 'Nikki', 'https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5279570-nikki', 'Aug 17, 2011', 'did not like it', '292', ' 2.5 stars.I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever read a book that\\'s left me quite as bemused as this one has. The writing left a lot to be desired, the heroine didn\\'t impress me at all and yet I find myself wanting to read the next in the series. After having a day to let this sink in I have to try and put my feelings succinctly into a review. How do I say this exactly......... Anastasia damn near killed me. There were just too many things about her that turned me off bigtime. I can understand how her vulnerability could make you warm to her, but it just made me frustrated more than anything.The attraction between Christian and Ana was intoxicating and I was invested in it for sure, but the way that Ana was written really let her down in my opinion. She was an innocent young woman with no sexual experience but her immaturity and childish demeanor really astounded me. At 21 surely she would have had a bit more understanding of the way the world works. The whole \"inner goddess vs subconscious\" thing was so ridiculous and referred to so many times that I literally wanted to beat my head open with my e-reader. And also - pigtails. PIGTAILS on a 21 year old are so not okay. I\\'m sorry but what??Her completely contradictory behaviour - wide eyed innocence and being totally petrified by Christian\\'s sexual tastes but thinking it\\'s hot at the same time. I validate her reasoning behind being nervous about it but honestly why go through with it? If that\\'s the only way you\\'re going to be able to have Christian - by signing up for something like that - then do it. But don\\'t carry on about it for the entire book. You\\'re either invested in him and the relationship or not at all. I\\'m sorry but I\\'m a realist. Another example of Ana\\'s immaturity and contradictory behaviour is how she got so angry at Kate for trying to rile Christian up and stoke his jealousy but then Ana did the exact same thing herself on the next page when she got the massage in first class and told him all about it. The game playing did not warm me to her whatsoever. In my status updates and other comments I stated how I felt the writing was awful. I really did, at least in the first half. The first person POV didn\\'t help matters either; the narrative was so stilted and had no flow. It read like, \"I did this and then this happened and I walked here and I made my bed\". The lack of structure was amateurish and painful and made me wonder if the book had been edited at all. So now that I\\'ve got that off my chest let\\'s talk about what I did like. A gorgeous multi-millionaire that becomes almost obsessed with you and wants to keep you for his very own? Any girl\\'s ultimate fantasy right? That aspect of this story is what got me hooked. The fact that Christian had a particular method and structure with his relationships also really drew me in. A dominant hero who finds himself in lust (and maybe even in love) with an innocent is quite fascinating to me and kept me reading. (view spoiler)[The BDSM didn\\'t bother me at all perhaps until the very end when the shit hit the fan. (hide spoiler)]And then miracle of miracles, Ana actually grew on me towards the latter part of the book. I found myself very emotionally involved especially in the last 30 or so pages and it was interesting the way the chips fell. That is why I intend to read the next book in the series where no doubt I will be huffing and puffing about Ana all over again. As an update..... I can\\'t believe my review is getting so many likes 9 months after reading this book. I thought I should let y\\'all know that I haven\\'t touched this trilogy since stumbling my way through this way back then.

So this is IT?!! The book that the whole world is in utter fascination with?!! I think someone is laughing their way to the bank.First, here is a mini review of this book in two GIFs:About the plot:About the writing:Got that??OK, now more of my sordid thoughts on this MASTERPIECE (**cough, cough**):So I shamelessly caved and read this book after repeatedly swearing I never would, but the publicity and hype finally won me over. (I also got a free copy of the book, no way was I going to pay for this.) And while I now have a better understanding of the fascination, I still don’t get it. Sure, there were some hot sex scenes, and at times Grey and Ana were both likable characters. I eventually even understood their fascination with each other. And I liked them when they were away from the whole BDSM/punishment/discipline/control freaky shit. Grey even had the sexual stamina of ten horny rabbits put together! What’s not to like about that? (Dang, that man is always hard and ready!!) But so much of this book was utterly disturbing! It primarily focused on Grey trying to coerce and manipulate her into being what HE needed, despite how much it would hurt her. He claimed to care for her and was patient, but it always boiled down to his need to punish and inflict pain. Outwardly he came across as a suave, polished and sophisticated normal person, but inwardly he was one sick dude. There were times they really were a great couple, but only when they were in a ‘normal’ environment. When the BDSM environment was involved, I wasn’t a fan of either of them. Initially I couldn’t understand what the heck Grey saw in Ana. A clumsy, mousy naïve girl who face plants on the ground (TWICE!), and then pukes her drunken gut out. (Uh right, what guy wouldn't get hot for a girl like that?) His quick attachment to her had me baffled for nearly the first half of the book. If all he wanted was a submissive with no romantic ties, why chose her? By his own words he no problem finding consenting partners before. After Grey reveals his proclivities, I figured Ana would run for the hills if she had a brain in her head. Unfortunately, she is a naïve virgin with no experience to even compare him to, and the poor girl is so blinded by how “OMG, he’s so HOT!” So when she actually entertains his twisted notions and begins negotiating terms of hard and soft limits, I wanted to scream at her! How stupid and naïve are you girl?!! WTF?? WHY?? She was too trusting, too unaware, and he was painting one rosy ass picture of how wonderful his lifestyle would be for her. Sorry, but signing over your free will into a sexual contract where you WILL get hurt is just F’d up, especially when your gut feelings are constantly telling you to flee. I’ll give Grey bonus points for his honesty at being so upfront with Ana, but that doesn’t make what he is about any less of a predator. He was honest with her about not wanting a normal ‘hearts and flowers’ relationship. If she agreed, she would be his submissive and enter into TRAINING. All he has to do is brainwash her into believing she would actually prefer this life style over the normal one she dreamed of. (WTF??!) Another aspect I did not get was how Ana repeatedly accuses him of having commitment issues, but throughout the book it was her that had one foot in the relationship and the other foot well outside of the door. He on the hand was far more committed, albeit with a strict set of ‘rules’. Despite all the WTFery and the disturbing portrayal of a young woman being coerced into an unknown and unsafe world, I was fascinated with the overall story. Like watching a train wreck fascinated, and nothing to be proud of. I found myself wanting to read just one more chapter and then another. So yes, this book was hard to put down. It was also hard not to pitch it at the wall! I honestly thought I would not want to read about BDSM, but surprisingly that aspect didn't even bother me all that much until the end (view spoiler)[The hard spanking scene was just cruel, as intended, and beyond disturbing!! (hide spoiler)]. If this was about two mutual consenting adults who fully understood what they were getting into, I might have even enjoyed it. But the constant coercion and manipulation killed the book for me. In the end this book really made me want to scrub myself clean with Christian's own go-to cure for all those bruising sore asses. (Oh, lovely!) Take some Advil. And rub on some Arnica cream to sooth ‘bruising, sprains and injuries’. The writing is another issue with this book. It wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared, but the euphemistic inner dialogue drove me nuts. The book often read like a comic book script, not a serious contemporary novel. All of the Oh, my! GASP! whoa! What?! Kabam! Pow Pow! (OK, not the last couple ones, but the rest are real!) were tiresome and over-done to death. Well…love it or hate it, this was one controversial and thought provoking book, just WAY too distributing for my personal taste. They say one man's trash is another man's treasure, and maybe in this case one woman's trashy mommy porn is another woman's hot treasured erotica.
